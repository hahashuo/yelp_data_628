The views of the Lake are great, but the food is just average for food in Austin. It was tasty enough, but nothing special. Most of my party had their fish tacos. The pineapple in the tacos was good, but the beans and guacamole was just average. I had the beef enchiladas. They had a little kick in the taste which I did like, but otherwise, they were unremarkable. Our waiter was trying to be helpful, but was slow to refill the beverages and restock the chips and salsa (also average, but not stale). There can be a bit of a wait to get in, but they are pretty efficient at getting you in queue so your party can wait in the bar, explore the gift shop or explore other options (like the onsite brewhouse or coffee shop). I think is is pretty easy to get lost, so keep your party together and your phone on, so you will get notified when it your time to get seated. Prices are moderate.", "date": "2017-02-19 07:02:42"}

Before coming here, I was told by many people to not expect good food. I guess people come for the views and the drinks. So my review is based just on that - we did not order any food. \n\nThe Oasis is about a 30-45 minute drive outside of downtown Austin. We came during Salsa Sunday which was on the top tier. They had a live band playing salsa music that had lots of people dancing! During 6pm, we were able to get a table pretty easily. I ordered a couple of mojitos and they were pretty decent. The only downside was the top floor we were on was not completely covered, and on a 100 degree day, there was barely any fans so it got really hot - especially more so with a hundred people dancing. I would definitely recommend better air systems.\n\nI'd love to come back here, because the views of the sunset over Lake Travis were definitely amazing!", "date": "2018-08-04 20:45:24"}

When we walked up we wondered if it was even open...the place looked like a ghost town. However, we were met by a couple of cheerful hostesses, one of whom sat us outside. There were only 3 tables that were occupied, counting our own. We decided on our drinks, looked over the menu a few times, decided on our food, waited, opened our napkins and saw both forks were dirty. Gross. We waited for about 15 minutes total and decided to leave because at this point we still hadn't been seen by anyone on the waitstaff. This was the last straw for us and we'll likely not go back.

I'm not a good salsa dancer but man this place was packed and blaring some good tunes from the live band. The man on the guitar jamming out had the crowd going nuts as well as the youngster lead singer making all the older ladies swoon. It was a fun night. The only problem is the salsa room doesn't have that much air moving thru so with all that body heat swirling around from everyone dancing man it made me a hot sweaty mess and not in the cute sexy way that they portray on those stupid axe commercials.

Big mistake. Even the view was disappointing as the lake water is very low due to drought conditions and the evening we were there the sky was very hazy so the sunset was \"meh.\" We're from Seattle where we have lakes, sun (sometimes!) and mountains so while this setting might be spectacular to some, it was just okay to us. Perhaps we are spoiled.\n\nThe Oasis is a bit of a drive from downtown Austin and really is quite a tourist trap. We were barely acknowledged by a gaggle of snotty sorority-like girls at the front desk who told us there was a 35 minute wait to sit outside but we could be seated immediately inside. There were literally 10 girls standing at the front desk doing nothing but giving us the stink eye, seeming to regale in the fact that us tourist \"losers\" could not sit outside. We did not come to sit inside but wanted to catch the sunset so we opted for a table inside the bar that had west-facing windows and we could meander outside to check out the view as we pleased. As we sat inside we watched numerous outside tables sit vacant the entire time we were there. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?\n\nWe waited and waited for service in the bar and finally went to the bartender to ask if we could order. He indicated he wasn't sure but didn't think anyone was working in our area (?) so if we wanted something to order from him. We ordered a couple of beers and chips and salsa. They didn't screw up the beer!\n\n15 minutes later the sun set, they rang a bell and that was that. We did not order any food as it didn't look very good and frankly, we were ready to leave. The experience left a bad taste in our mouths. Bottom line, it was a waste of time getting out there, service was rude to non-existence and even the view was overrated.

They have never really been known for their food. It's always been about that beautiful view of the sunset and the lake.\n\nI remember going here after I graduated from high school. By the way, lightning struck and burned down a chunk of the decks the very next day! June 2005, I believe. Since that time back in 2005, I really feel like The Oasis has turned the corner from mediocre weekend spot to dependable gathering point for you and your friends.\n\nThe development of everything surrounding the restaurant has struggled financially. The restaurant has always stayed strong though. The developer had large plans to build a domain style shopping paradise. Uncle Billys used to be right next door. I wouldn't have called the BBQ there great enough for the drive though.\n\nNow it seems like everything is going well for the restaurant. The parking garage is in. The walkway was built a few years ago. They seem to have also repurposed the Uncle Billy's brewery area for their own 'Oasis brewery'.\n\nWe had a group of 15 people for a little friendly gathering. The Oasis doesn't do reservations, but you can call ahead and they really do their best to accommodate your party. We arrived at 7 on a busy Saturday evening. The line had about 75 people in it already. Like a machine, the staff worked through each group. There is a large bar on the 3rd level where everyone ends up drinking while they wait for a table. There is also live music on this level.\n\nOur group called ahead the day before and were given a wait time of about an hour to an hour and a half. We were initially disappointed, but then our buzzer started buzzing about 2 minutes later. They had indeed saved us an area for our large group.\n\nDefinitely call ahead if you are planning a large gathering. Your entire group must be present before they can be seated.

Not so much this time. We arrived at the Oasis at 8:45 pm and we're told there was a 45 minute wait.  To make the most out of our wait, we went upstairs to a local brewery (that has Fantastic views) and all split a $20 flight of beer which arrived at 8:55. At 8:55 we were also texted by the Oasis saying are table was ready (What? 45 min wait is cut down to 10 min). We told the Oasis to give our table up to the next in line so we could drink the beer we just purchased. They said we would have to come now or we would not be seated b/c restaurant closed at 9:00. I asked them why they told us 45 min wait at 8:45 if restaurant closed at 9:00?  In hindsight, there were plenty of tables available at 8:45 -- the 45 min wait response I believe was to discourage us from coming since they closed at 9. We had to throw out our $20 flight of beer and rush downstairs. We ordered $140 worth of food and drink at the Oasis and I wanted the Oasis Manager, Bill Enney, to simply make us whole on the upstairs beer transaction which he refused to do. Although he comped us queso, I found this gesture inadequate. They also weren't sure if they could get us extra salsa or tortillas since the kitchen was closing therefore I would recommend not coming to this restaurant later than 8:00 pm on a weeknight.

What has not been said about the horrible food??  The food at the Oasis is below what you could get at Taco Cabana or Taco Bell (and we're not even fans of Taco Cabana and Taco Bell). I know people give it 5 stars for the view but come on? How could you give a rating of 5 for Nature when that would be there regardless. The food is horrible, the service sucks, and the drinks are watered down. \n\nWe went on a Saturday and the wait was very long. First you have to find parking. The parking lot is 3 times the size it used to be but there still was nothing available. After fighting everyone else to find parking, you have to stand outside in a line like you're at a theme park for 20 - 30 minutes. Then you get a pager and are told that your wait would be about 1 hour. Since the wait was long, we went up to the bar. It was packed and it took us about 15 minutes to get a drink. We ordered the house margarita and we later found out that we were served their Perfect Margarita which is $8. For an $8 drink it was horrible, light on the alcohol and watered down. I wish I could give them the excuse that it had been sitting at the bar for a while but we ordered it at the bar. \n\nWe were finally seated an hour and a half later so the total wait was 2 hours, waiting 30 minutes in line, and then the hour and a half wait. The place is designed for the view so we did have a table with a great view. The view is never anyone's complaint about the Oasis. \n\nWhen we saw the menu we noticed that we were not served the standard house margarita for $6.25 at the bar and asked our server for 2 house margaritas. It took a good 10 minutes to get our drinks and like the first ones these were not great so we didn't think anything of it.  \n\nWe ordered the quesadilla and fish tacos. While placing our order we asked for chips and salsa and were snobbishly told that they are not complimentary and that they would charge us $2.95. We said, \"You can keep your chips and so-called salsa.\"  What good old-fashioned Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa???  I have never been to any Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurant, for that matter, that charges for chips and salsa. We got our food about 20 minutes later and thought it was horrible. \n\nThe shredded pork in the quesadilla ($9.95) was the highlight of the whole meal. It was tasty however, the tortilla was soggy, squishy, dripping, and soaked with mango salsa liquid. It was so runny that it ran between your fingers and made the bottom tortilla into dough and tasted like crap.  How can you screw up a quesadilla?! Seriously!\n\nThe fish tacos ($14.95) - Where was the fish!?  For the fish that you could find in your taco, it was dry, rubbery, and flavorless. The rice was an overcooked ball of mush with some type of seasoning. The black beans came straight out of the Hill Country Fare cans from HEB. \n\nWhen we got the bill we noticed that we were charged $8 each for the margaritas, again. We asked out waitress why we were charged for the Perfect Margarita. She told us that the regular margaritas are watered down, horrible, and they never recommend or serve them to their customers. So basically they take it upon themselves to upgrade your drinks because they know their own drinks suck. \n\nThis was not our first time here but it will be our last. We refuse to go back - EVER!  No matter how many new friends or family comes to visit, co-workers from out of state visit, happy hour requests, holidays, 4th of July fireworks, end of Summer parties, someone begging us to go......you get the hint, we're not returning.  \n\nSomeone said in a prior review, which I wish I had read before going on a whim, that the only thing you can do is go and enjoy a few drinks. I don't think its even worth it to go there for that because as I stated above, the margaritas tasted like flavored water. The only way it might be worth it is if you drink a few beers, or eat and drink before you get there or somewhere else and plan on standing around people watching. \n\nService sucks, food sucks, drinks suck....not much else to add to our review.", "date": "2009-05-30 23:48:36"}

Since they don't take reservations, we expected at wait of at least 45 minutes.

Our waitress did not offer drink refills to our end of the table, we had to request them. She didn't clear away any empty glasses or plates. To her credit, she did cater to the other end of the table quite nicely and with a nice attitude. Not sure why she didn't do the same for those of us at the other end. \n\nThe food came out fast, that's about the only good thing I can say about that. I ordered the Texas Red Fish with rice and saut\u00e9ed vegetables. The fish was over cooked and dry, the vegetables consisted mainly of barely cooked peppers and onions, a few small pieces of broccoli, and inedible asparagus stems. The butter cilantro lime \"sauce\" on the side was downright nasty. Just to make sure it wasn't me, I had my sister taste the fish and the \"sauce\" and watched her grimace. I was able to eat some of the fish only because I was hungry. The rice wasn't bad but was quite bland. \n\nIn my opinion, the only thing this place has to offer is the amazing view. If you're just going to sit on the patio at sunset, have some drinks, and take in the view, you'll probably enjoy it.", "date": "2016-07-15 23:45:04"}

We have been here before and it is fun with a group of people or just a couple but the service is terrible. I am writing this review because I just got back form this place with an empty stomach. My group and I ordered our drinks and an appetizer. The waitress brought out our drinks and we never saw her again. We sat for an hour enjoying the \"great view\" and never saw our server or food, our drinks were empty and we couldn't even get our check, so we just got up and went inside and called for a manager. Once I spoke to the manager, he looks at my check then says he comped my app...(I never even got it) I said that I don't believe I should pay for the 2 drinks because we wanted more and we never saw our food or server. Then he said \"you drank the alcohol didn't you \" and my wife and I only had one each. He was rude and it was horrible customer service because he had a bad attitude about the whole situation while I was cool about it. Bottom line is the food is HORRIBE, (id rather eat at Taco Bell) the service STINKS and the management has bad customer service. They lost our service and I would give it 0 stars if I could.

We asked to be seated outside, and we got a table directly in the sun with no umbrella, which wasn't too bad when I sat with my back to the sun (but then I couldn't see the view). We got our waters and ordered some queso and a beer-Rita to start, I was looking at my water when I realized tiny little bugs were literally raining down on us. They brought out the queso and before they could set it down we asked if we could have a different table because of the bug storm, and they said they would go ask, and still placed the queso on the table. Then they came out with my beer-Rita and asked if we had asked to be moved, and put down my drink so they could go find out where we could be moved to. Then a manager looking man came up to our table to ask if we had asked to be moved, and said he would find a new table for us. At this point I was annoyed because we asked to be moved before we got our food so we didn't have bugs landing in our food and they still placed our queso and my drink down at the table where it was raining bugs. Our queso was cold (and had bugs on it) by the time we got to our new table so we had to scrape off the top layer, and my beer-Rita also had a few bugs that had fallen in to it, other than the bugs I was also disappointed in both the quality and quantity for it being $12. Once we got settled inside we ordered the fajita plate, it came out surprisingly fast. The taste was very mediocre. The service was good.

The only pro for this company, is their location! For that, you can just go visit Lake Travis and save money! Their location is also probably why everything on their menu is ridiculously overpriced! I wouldn't mind paying a higher price if their food was actually tolerable. I order the combo fajitas, thinking to myself, well at least either one of the chicken or fajita will taste good, right? WRONG! My chicken was bland, no spices, flavor or nothing and my fajita looked very undercooked and did not have any flavor either! Everybody in our party ordered something different and nobody liked their plate or shared any positive reviews. Their chips are store bought chips used for nachos you typically buy in school, not even tortilla chips! Of course their salsa is store bought too, like Tostitos. Unfortunately, my Matron of Honor got food poisoning from the fajita nachos plate she ordered. She was constantly having to go to restroom due to the frequency of feeling ill! She even burst an eye vessel due to vomiting so frequently! It was definitely the fajita meat, because she became very ill right after eating there, to the point where she was unable to go with us out that night to celebrate! I would give The Oasis ZERO STARS and am advising everyone i know to stay away!! They really need to get new management and start all over, if they want to continue to stay in business! \n\nOh and staff is very rude! Get some customer service training!", "date": "2016-03-08 01:20:29"}

It is just one of those places that the food is not so top notch but the drinks and atmosphere is what keeps people coming back. Their waiting area, yes it gets that packed, has a bar and stage for singers and a dance floor. From here, you move toward your table and, depending on the weather, you could get a great table outside. If you do, the view is just great.\n\nThere are have been many times where we have sat outside and the weather was perfect. \n\nThe menu is just one page broken into three sections of types of dishes. The prices are mostly above $10 dollars and can go higher then $30 or more. The fish and steak dishes are the higher priced items.\n\nIf you plan on visiting this place, try to go when it is not a busy time, friday night or weekends, and try it out when you can actually walk around and see the different rooms. The staff here is also nice but mostly of college type students. The surrounding environment is just great for taking pictures with friends/family. The gift shop is a fun place to visit so be sure to set some time for that.\n\nIf you go, plan ahead so you have time and try to get a table outside with a great view, and if they move you to a table not as close, just ask and they will be happy to help, at least they did for when I went.", "date": "2011-02-16 18:32:40"}

I think her name was Zero or something (it was sunny and my contacts are weak) but she had such an attitude. \n\nYes, we had a large group but all we asked is if we can put two tables together as they had put us on this weird long bench.

Restaurants are closed and ,with the exception of a jerky shop and a small winery, all of the retail spots are empty. Ghost town.\n\nSome may attribute the demise to the drought that poor Lake Travis is currently suffering; however, the downfall began well before the Lake started to disappear. \n\nTip: Go to the Iguana Grill just a short drive down 620.

I would have never bothered trying it with all the terrible reviews.\n \nFirst off let me start by saying we showed with a group of 11 at 530 on Saturday May 13th and we were not sat until after 9pm. We were told 1.5 hours and continued to be told another 30 minutes. Thank goodness one of my friends was bold enough to stay down by the hostess until we were seated. If not, I don't think they would have ever sat us. \n\nSecond, once we finally sat down we immediately ordered drinks and food because by 9pm we were all starving. Part of the food started showing up before we even got our margaritas and before one girl even got iced tea. Then to make up for it they brought mojitos... which nobody even at our table ordered a mojito? WHY? One of the girls in our party had enough and refused to pay for her margarita... which I don't blame her she was halfway through dinner before they brought it to the table. No apology, no manager to the table, nothing. They knew with 11 in our party they were guaranteed a tip... so why bother? \n\nThird, half of our table ordered shrimp tacos. They were so spicy they could barely even eat them. I absolutely love spicy foods and even I couldn't choke it down. \n\nLAST and FINAL STRAW and why I will be putting in call directly to the owner/manager on duty... everyone that ordered the shrimp tacos suffered from food poisoning. All of the girls were throwing up and had diarrhea all night. Some of these people had to get on flights the next day... they could barely walk from dizziness because they were so dehydrated from throwing up everything.\n\nIts just a shame... that location is unreal, but honestly if I could write a review every day to eliminate people from coming here I would.

We went here looking solely for a few cocktails and a nice view. That was my only expectation. And did The Oasis manage to screw it up? Yup.\n\nUpon entering we, very specifically but very politely, asked the hostess for a table right up against the railing as we wanted to enjoy the view. We added that if none were available at the moment, we would be more than happy to wait. It was mid-afternoon, there were ample tables available, tons of servers. This was not an unreasonable request. The hostess acknowledged that request then promptly leads us to a table nowhere near a railing, crammed underneath a fan and smashed between four other tables. We looked at her slightly confused, then, still very politely, said \"I'm sorry, I must have been confusing, we would like a table against a railing so that we can enjoy the view.\" With this, the hostess audibly huffs, plops the menus down on the crap table, and tells us now she has to walk all the way back up and ask her manager where else she can put us. Then she leaves there and stomps off.  After a few minutes we wonder WTF we're supposed to be doing and we trek back up the stairs to find her on the phone with aforementioned manager, clearly very put out that we really do want the scenic table we asked her for the first time and we weren't making a joke. She caught us recognizing her shit attitude and promptly took us to a railing table like we originally asked for, we thanked her, and she bounded off to give her shit attitude to the next poor patron. \n\nSo yay, we now had our lovely table overlooking the lake! What a view, fantastic! A bus boy brought chips and salsa, which were not good - but they're chips and salsa and I'm of the opinion that even bad chips and salsa are pretty good. In a few minutes our server arrived and took our order. While he wasn't very enthused about his job, he wasn't outright awful either. We put our order in, figuring queso, fajitas and a burger should be safe. The server took our empty basket of chips at this time, promising a refill. A few moments later, a busboy brought our queso. We mentioned that we had no chips and he promised to be right back with some. We waited. And we waited. We watched the queso congeal and get hard on the top. And then our entrees arrived, sigh. We told the busboy who brought the entrees to just take the congealed queso back, that we never received any chips to eat it with and now the entrees had arrived. He did so without any comment at all.\n\nThe burger and fajitas weren't terrible, they were about what you'd expect at an Applebees. No one got sick, thank god. And that's about all I can say of the food. \n\nOur actual server returned after we'd finished eating and dropped off the bill. He didn't ask how it was, if he could bring us anything else. We didn't get offered a refill on the beer or margaritas we'd ordered, water, never did get the chips. His only remark was that he took the queso off our bill as requested. Well, that was big of him. Pay the bill and f-you very much. \n\nSo... the whole experience was right on par with the other 575+ Yelp reviews. Crap service, crap food, stunning view. Is the view worth it though? Nope.

We ordered the Texas Red Fish and it was HORRIBLE, it was dry and hard, the rice that came with it had no taste and the vegetables were oddly placed, did not go with the dish at all and tasted like they were straight from a can. I know we should of have expected it but I thought given the higher price of the dish it might be better quality. Complete waste of money, the entire dish was inedible. We also ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, it was edible but not worth the price we paid for it. The queso was pretty good but also over-priced. There is no way this place doesn't know their food sucks, it almost feels as if they are so busy they don't want to serve food they know people will still come for the alcohol and the view. Also the women's bathroom was disgusting.

We all planned on tipping him well because we felt bad for him but we all left 0 because of what the management did.

First off, the view is wonderful - especially, when the lake is not low. The sunsets can really be amazing, and this viewpoint can really capture it all. I would definitely recommend sitting out on one of their many patios (people don't go there to sit inside), and enjoy the sunset with one of their extremely overpriced/unimpressive beverages. Avoid the appetizers, especially the chips and processed queso; should you choose to have them, remember me telling you \"I told you so.\" The food options aren't as bad as they used to be; they have certainly come a long way, but they also have a ways to go before I'll spend money to eat here again. Given that it is a hike away from Austin central, I do appreciate the atmosphere and all the surrounding shops/eateries that they have put up in the area so that you can enjoy more than just the view when you have to drive 40 minutes to get there. If you are a music fan, they do have a small but great open-air music venue on the top floor, which they use periodically to host live music - so check their calendar on the website.

I wanted to take my mother to their Mothers Day brunch they were hosting on Sunday May 14th, I am from out of town and my mother was very excited to eat here and show this place off.  I checked out the brunch online and it said that reservations were required for the brunch, so I called and attempted to make a reservation but the hostesses said not to worry, that reservations are not required.  Confused I called back again the next day and tried to make the Mother's Day reservation, the second hostesses told me it was on a \"first come, first served\" basis.  I also asked my husband to call and see if he could figure out what the heck was going on with brunch at this place.  Anyway Mother's Day comes and we drive up to the oasis after church. We arrived at 11am and we are told that yes reservations are required, and we did not have one even though we had been trying all week to get a straight honest answer from anyone about this damn brunch.  So we put our names in and waited 40 minutes for a table, and decided to eat off the lunch menu because we were already there.  I had a burger with skimp toppings, seriously could get a nicer burger from any fast food joint. The view of the lake was nice. This place is just ok, but what really pissed me off was how the management seemed completely disinterested with our situation.  And how mislead I was that entire week trying to make the damn brunch reservation, management said it had been sold out since Sunday night. Then why not just tell me that in one of the 3 phone calls I made to you Oasis? It could have been so easy to go anywhere else and have a nice brunch.

It was well worth it. \n\nAlong with the delicious margarita, it made for a nice sunny, kinda too warm day to view the lake and how gorgeous the scene is from The Oasis. Recommended, but obviously only for a view ... or the shrimp burger!", "date": "2012-04-02 23:31:34"}

The server cleaned one table and we had to keep calling them to clean the other one.... then started the long wait for the menu and complimentary chips and salsa... we had to literally get up and go look for the manager to get started, he said he is taking care of it... but still 40 Minutes since we were seated and that too after letting them know that the kids were very hungry, nobody showed up .. we looked around, and the people who had come after us had already started getting their food, and we were completely neglected... finally one of us went looking for a manager again, and found his boss, who said he was going to expedite our order due to the delay... we gave our order, but again had to keep enquiring till they brought the expedited order 40 minutes later... \n\nBottom line - STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLCE", "date": "2018-04-16 17:33:08"}

This place is an absolute embarrassment to Austin.  I can get the view in plenty of other places and not put up with 1) zero hospitality, 2) poor service, 3) severe lack of cleanliness throughout, and 4) atrocious food... all leaving no doubt that they, Oasis owner/management, could not care less about salvaging any semblance of pride.\n\nVisited 7/25/16 and it will be my last time to grace them with my presence.  Starting at front door, hostesses did not greet (3 of them gathered around hostess area chatting) but had to be prompted by us regarding a table, even though there were no other guests waiting to be seated.  It was raining, so they seemed to be more concerned regarding \"why are people still coming and we're not getting to go home early.\"  Yes, we actually overheard them discussing this.  Great job Oasis management on instilling customer service skills in the persons that make the first impression on your guests.  \n\nOnce seated, the service was slow and extremely sub-par throughout.  Not a smile to be seen and we seemed to be as much an inconvenience to our waiter as we were to the hostesses.  Guess there's not a lot of motivation to provide quality when you have the 18% gratuity locked in before the guests are even seated... unless quality is a part of the culture of the restaurant.  That's doesn't appear to be in the vocabulary at the Oasis.  I always tip and have zero issue with giving a super tip beyond this amount, but it ought to be earned, not guaranteed.  That's what most of us have to do, work for and EARN our pay, not lollygag through because we know it's already coming our way.\n\nAt this point there wasn't much doubt where this was heading, and yes, the lack of quality carried over to the food.  Absolutely the worst beef enchiladas I've ever had.  Looked like they came out of a banquet frozen dinner, with some garbage rice concoction on the side and charro beans straight out of the can.  Zero seasoning on any of it.  Tasteless garbage.    \n\nCan't leave off the trip to the men's room.  Looked like it gets cleaned about once a week at best and in severe need of an update.  Icky to the max.  Very nasty and disgusting.\n\nI'll be back to Chuy's as fast as possible to get the anti-Oasis treatment and food that always leaves me with a smile... and if I can't make it to Chuy's I'll swing into Taco Bell where they can match the quality of the Oasis for about 1/10th the price.\n\nFor any persons visiting our great city, please do yourself a favor and skip the Oasis.  We would like you to return home with the right impression of Austin.  There are plenty of quality places to spend your money on great food and if you're looking for the view, tons of places for that too.", "date": "2016-07-26 19:07:58"}

Since then the place had burned down, going through many changes, and additional add-on structures, etc. Since we moved we decided that why not go there for our anniversary for nostalgia. Our expectations were low based upon others' reviews of this place and sadly they were correct.\n\nWe arrived here on a Thursday early evening and barely recognized the place due to all the additional buildings and structures. The place is surrounding by small shops, Oasis brewery, parking garage, etc. Basically the Oasis turned into some weird beachy tourist trap. It was odd to see all these statues outside of the oasis. It was like someone puked up statues. I later learned it was due to some store that was selling them or something.\n\nMoving on into the Oasis, there was a small wait to get a table since they didn't have enough servers to accommodate the influx of people trying to grab a bite to eat. Once we were led down 2-3 flights of stairs we landed at our small table. I got the Oasis Sunset drink which was decent tasting and got me a nice buzz. Their hurricane drinks are a minimum of 2 per person. My husband got the spicy banana drink. He said it was good but got overwhelmingly sweet towards the end of it. We were given a huge basket of chips and salsa to munch on while we waited for our food.\n\nOur food came out very shortly after we ordered it. It was weird since normally you wait a little bit for fajitas and it was also kind of busy. For our main meal we got the combo fajitas for two people. We got shrimp, chicken, corn tortillas, cheese, sour cream, beans, rice, guacamole, salsa, etc. The food was meh but we were hungry so we ate what we wanted. The service was not great. We saw our waitress only a few time throughout the meal. I don't even think she checked in on us after we got the food. \n\nI would recommend if you feel the need to come here, come for the view (beautiful!!) and an overpriced hurricane drink.", "date": "2017-03-17 19:52:37"}

I noticed at least one other eatery, a coffee shop (almost coughed up an extra star just for that!), probably if I had kept looking around I could have found even more, maybe offices, condos, tattoo parlors, pawn shops, who knows...\n\nOnce seated inside, I noted that the menu seemed much smaller than when I had last visited, featuring just a small handful of run-of-the-mill mexi dishes.

I really wanted to love The Oasis, but the food and sevice were truly unacceptable. For starters, the tortillas used for the enchiladas were atrocious. The cold raw flour tortillas weren't fully cooked whatsoever.\nI was unaware that when you ask for your check they provide you with a partial check, and then take it upon themseleves to charge your card for an amount you are unaware of! This is very unsettling because we specifically told our server to split our bill. At the time our check said $49.00, so we told the server we would each be paying $25 each. My friend was paying her half in cash and I was paying my half with my bank card. Well when our server returned he handed me a receipt with a $46 charge on my card! He didnt say a word, he must have thought I wasn't going to notice! So the manager comes to the table and explains that the check he gave us was a partial check. Wait, what?! So our total was really $71, but even so, WHY WASN'T I NOTIFIED BEFORE HE UNLAWFULLY RAN MY CARD FOR AN AMOUNT I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE!!! He could have came back to the table and told us the actual total so my friend and I could have split it evenly from there. The manager seemed incredibly unappologetic, and said there really wasn't anything she could do. She also stated that if she voided it, I most likely wouldn't get my money for another week, so I would basically have a double charge on my card. What the f***?\nAnyone thinking of going please remember 2 things: Don't order the enchiladas and make sure they provide you with the TOTAL check amount.", "date": "2017-06-19 17:16:42"}

Service is extremely slow & bad.  \n\nReview:\nWe (my girlfriend and I) decided to have dinner here last night.  I have eaten at the Uncle Billy's at this location.  I wanted to show my girlfriend the view.  We were seated, after about 6 minutes a server came for our drink order.  He also asked for appetizers.  We ordered the Queso.  After another 8 minutes or so he brought me my ice tea but he brought my GF water instead the lemonade she ordered.  At this time he also asked if it was Queso that we had ordered earlier.  This tells me that he didn't put our order in earlier.    It took about another 5 minutes for my GF to get her lemonade.  Another 5 minutes out came the queso & chips.  At this time we placed our order.  She ordered a tilapia dish and I got the burger and fries.  The queso was terrible.  It was more like cheez-whiz that you can find at any grocery store.\n\n25 minutes or so later came our entrees.  (during this entire 25 minutes the waiter never came to refill drinks)  The Tilapia dish was $18, it was terrible.  The entrees were delivered by a bus boy type of person as he wasn't our server.  Soon as he left I realized they didn't bring me any ketchup for my fries/burger.  I waited about 7 minutes before our server came.  He didn't even really come to check on us.  he showed up to take the drink order of the table next to us and I just waved to get his attention.  I asked him for ketchup and it took forever for him to come back (atleast 6 minutes).  All the while my food is getting cold.  When he finally did come back I started eating and boy was it the blandest food ever.  Service was so bad & slow that I gave a 7% tip.  That is something that I never do as I have grown up in the restaurant industry.  For me to leave such a bad tip it's because service was terrible.  I never base tip on food taste because that's not the server's fault.  I will never come back here to eat again.\n\nWhen I come back to this area again I will try Soleil which is right next door.", "date": "2012-07-23 15:10:39"}

In my most recent visit from Houston to reward the employees associated with my medical company, I asked the Austin staff to meet me at the Oasis. All was well, we had a great time on the patio, except our waitress, Theresa, seemed unhappy to serve us. She was a bit older than my mid thirties team, maybe early to mid forties. Since this was a company reward, I decided to treat the team to whatever they wanted, and just hang out since we are so far apart most of the time with our headquarters being located in Houston, where I currently reside. \nTheresa seemed to be much more engaged with her other tables than she was with ours, our drinks were left empty for long periods of time and our table left with dirty dishes while we had our post lunch meeting. \nWhen I received the check from her I noticed a gratuity was added. On the actual receipt it mentioned gratuities for parties of 7 or more...  our party was a party of 5 for all of the time we were there, with 1 additional employee showing up after we ate, and only ordering 1 glass of water. \nWhile I do understand that we did sit there for a few hours enjoying each other and the scenery, we were buying drinks, and continuing to be kind throughout the entire visit. \nWhen I received the bill, I intended on tipping her for the time we were occupying her table, but as I read the receipt I saw that she had placed the gratuity on our table of 5 eaters and 1 water only drinker. Keep in mind that I also own a restaurant in Houston in addition to the Medical company whose team I was meeting with in Austin. I feel as if Theresa saw my table of mid thirties masters and bachelor degree professionals, who all make 6 figures a year, as one that would not accommodate her time. I went ahead and left her only her requested gratuity, even though normally I would have tipped way more for this type of event. \nEmployees like Theresa, give this place a lower review that it should receive. \nMy suggestion would be to not assume anything. And to let Theresa go..", "date": "2018-04-07 01:36:19"}

When she brought it out it was cold and just bad - half heated frozen pizza.\nAt this point I was more than ready to leave and asked for my bill.  When my server brought it, she had already run my card without even letting me look it over and after I had explicitly said I would pay cash.  Not only that, she charged me for 2 items I never ordered!  I demanded to see a manager.   Several minutes later a manager came out with a void receipt.  No apology or anything, just a void receipt and a demand for payment.  I pointed out that the debited amount appeared on my online banking but the credited amount did not and that I was not going to give him another cent for a meal I never got to eat until I could see a credit.  He disappeared again and came back out a few minutes later to tell me he had taken care of the bill and walked off.\nOasis, take some pride in yourselves.

The drinks were a little on the weak side in my opinion.  Come on a Saturday and expect about an hour and a half wait.\n\nHere's what boosted the star value for me - the fact that there are a couple bars onsite where you can chill while waiting for your table.  I love that they take your phone number and text when your table is ready - you don't have to worry about them calling your name while you're out of earshot.  As the sun starts to go down workers come out of the woodwork to take down the umbrellas, giving everyone a great view of the lake and sunset.  It's pretty cool how efficient they are with this considering there are hundreds of umbrellas (this place is HUGE).  And finally, they had a pretty sweet band playing the night I was there.  And they weren't playing country music (yes, I am a hater).  \n\nAll in all, it's a great place to go on a date or with a group of friends if you don't have anything else to do for the night.

One of them told me about a really nice restaurant that I had to visit while traveling there.  We looked this restaurant up on YELP, of course.  The reviews and photos were pretty good; however, my experience was not that great. Driving up to the restaurant was so exciting because it was a beautiful scene.  They have ample parking.  It looks like a mini city mall, but all spruced up and nice.  We visited at about 6:30 p.m. on Thursday 6/29/17.  The hostess walked us upstairs to where we would be seated.  We sat indoors because it was too hot and humid to sit outside; however, they do have fans and water misters handing from the ceilings.  We received chips and salsa pretty fast. A very nice gentlemen by the name of \"Chris\" served us.  It took forever for anyone to come to our table and serve us.  We ordered the queso because it look fabulous on YELP.  IT was really good.  So, bad thing here was when they finally brought the queso out, we had eaten the chips and needed more chips with the queso. There were some servers that passed by, but they never looked our way. They only focused on who they were tending too.  We waited and waited.  I got up out of my seat and went to look for someone. I found the hostess that sat us and I told her how my frozen drink came out watery, we needed more chips, and now the queso was cold.  She found the waiter and he came over and took the item back.  They prepared another drink for me and this time it WAS frozen.  YAY, I'm happy now, but the queso didn't come out.  We did finally order our food and that took forever.  My daughter didn't like the pull pork sliders. She said the bread tasted weird.  The server got lost again. UGH.  We had to find someone else to ask to replace the item.  They took it back and was very cordial about it.  My burger with the pretzel bun was really good. I would definitely order again, but I won't be going back to this restaurant any time soon.  They lacked customer service...BIG TIME.  It was a slow day so I'm unsure as to why the service was so horrible.  Oasis, you have a good restaurant and you really need to fix this problem, because I know you get much busier and I'm unsure how you handle this if we were treated this way.  Oh yeah, it's very pricey.  My burger was 16.95 because I asked for a pretzel bun instead of the regular bun so they up-charged me $2+. The server said they could substitute the bun, but he didn't say there would be an up-charge.  \nThe ambiance is very nice.  The view is phenomenal.  If you want to experience the atmosphere than this is a perfect tourist attraction.  Our suggestion is to order a few drinks, eat chips and salsa, & take pictures at sunset.   It's sad that I had to rant, but this is the truth. I hope others have a better experience than we did.", "date": "2017-07-01 16:18:12"}

There's even shops and a beer distillery near the restaurant. The place looks like a Mexican styled mansion with multiple floors. I think my favorite part of going to the Oasis was the view . Not only the beautiful view of the lake (which we didn't get to see since it got dark when we got there) but the inside of the establishment. The decor was very vibrant and colorful. The bar area was fun and relaxing. You can hang out there while you wait for your text confirmation to come through. The drinks are delicious but definitely tourist priced. The good thing is that you get to keep your drink glass as a souvenir for a couple of the drinks that cost about $12. The chips and salsa are decent. The meals we got were pretty delicious.  I got fish tacos but I changed my sauce for jalape\u00f1o ranch which was tasty. My beau got the sour cream enchiladas which he enjoyed and devoured. We were both huge fans of the rice which was very well seasoned and soft. The charro beans were not very enjoyable.  They lacked flavor big time . I wish the service was a little better in terms of wait time but we were patient with our waitress because we knew she had plenty of tables to attend to .

You're literally paying out the wazoo to sit on a deck overlooking gorgeous views of Lake Travis. \n\nI came here with a few best friends and we waited for our buzzer to go off in the air conditioned bar. We were brought to our table by a good looking/really friendly host. If only HE were the server. Our waitress was a young college student (but let's be honest: most servers are). She brought out waters immediately...and that's where the good service ended. She didn't come back to the table for 15 mins to take our order. Then when she did come back we gave her our drink order and she rushed off before we could order food. And let's just get this out of the way: the waitress had a 3 table section.\n\nAnother 15 minutes passed and then she brought out our drinks. I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita with sugar on the rim. What did I get? A strawberry slush margarita with no sugar. I didn't complain because by that point our waitress probably had her head so far up her butt she had no idea what was going on. We practically had to maul her to get her to not leave the table so we could order food.\n\nThe food? Mediocre at best. You can get most of what they serve at a little cafe down the road from your house/apartment, I'm sure--and for 1/2 the price. We're talking at least $10-$25 a plate for cheap stuff. \n\nThen, randomly, towards the end of our meal another waiter appears asking if he can get us anything or if we've ordered yet. Uh, homeboy, we have food RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. He then kept coming by at odd times asking us the same questions our actual server had asked. I've been a waitress before and I'm very familiar with tandem waiting and shift change...this was neither and was just odd.\n\nBy the end of it I've sworn no more Oasis for food.

Dillon moved us, after the hostess station told us that it would be an hour wait for a table by the water. We had been sat at a cramped table near the front door but Dillon saw us, picked up our high chair and moved us to a private room, where my daughter could crawl around on the carpeted floor. Cassie brought us every possible assortment of beans - so that my daughter had a variety of soft foods to eat. Then we were steered toward the best possible drinks and dishes. After the meal, we went and bought candy at the candy store (which was amazing candy by the way), and some fun things at their boutique store- where the girl personally wrapped the things up with paper and ribbon so we could give the things away as gifts.

I live in Houston and eat it all the time.  But yes, the food is very overpriced...I had the cheese enchiladas and they looked and tasted EXACTLY like TV dinners from El Patio.  Whew, brought back some bad college budget memories for me!\n\nMy beef is with the horrible, horrible, horrible service.  We chose to celebrate my cousin's graduation at Oasis.  We called ahead, since we had 16 adults and 2 children in our party.  I understand that they don't take reservations - no biggie, the place was empty when we arrived at 4 p.m. on Friday.\n\nHere's a rundown:\n- We were seated immediately, so far so good.  \n\n-  We ordered at least six appetizers, and the four year old ordered a $16 entree from the adult menu.  Since gratuity is automatic and we had such a large party, the kid waiting on us got paid pretty well.\n\n-The two year old spilled her water (somewhat their fault for not putting a lid on it, ya think?).  Our waiter noticed that it was spilled (he was taking our order at the time) but didn't offer to help.  He also didn't bring us any extra napkins.  So we had a pile of wet linen napkins on one table.  \n\n- Ten minutes later, Grandma spilled her drink.  Same story as above.  At this point, a pile of 16 napkins was on the table and our food had arrived.  We had to ASK the idiot to take the wet napkins from grandma's place and bring dry napkins for all of us!\n\n- Food was \"auctioned off\" to us from one end of the table.  And when the other end of the table could not hear the auctioning, the watier got visibly irritated and stomped around yelling \"Who ordered the Bistec Salad?\".  When I am paying $15-20 a plate, auctioning my food off is just unacceptable.\n\n-  Nobody ever checked on us after the food was brought.  Good thing we were hungry and didn't need anything else!\n\nI'm grateful that my uncle treated us to a nice, casual meal, but I am so super annoyed that he had to fork over quite a bit for non-existent service.", "date": "2009-06-08 21:25:37"}

Come on, this for $15?\n\nMy wife's black bean burger was nothing more than a frozen patty (confirmed by waitress that it was not made on-site) re-heated with a dab of guacamole on top, but it was at least edible.  Props to Morningstar or whoever the Oasis buys them from.\n\nOur friend's fajitas were also edible, but how hard is it to mess up fajitas? The meat was only lightly seasoned and cut into rather large chunks.\n\nThanks for providing the view over the years, but it is evident that the owners are skimping on the food quality to repay the massive development costs of the new complex.  What a shame.  They would be better off having some of the Austin food trailer folks set up shop and handle the food and charge them parking fees.", "date": "2012-04-07 12:33:58"}

We got a nice table overlooking the lake of course, and started out with hurricane drinks. I got the Tropical depression which was super and you get to take home the glass. We received complimentary chips and salsa for the table and then decided to order the chicken fajita nachos. Anything we ordered came out fairly quickly. The portion size of the nachos was ok. Flavor was ok. Best thing was the accompanying guac and pico that came alongside. \n\nNear time for sunset the staff comes around and puts down all the umbrellas so everyone has an unobstructed view.

I ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries and it was out of this world!! I got extra guacamole from my sisters plate who ordered fish tacos and my dad ordered a classic cheeseburger which was not bad! The meat was pretty juicy despite the burgers looking charred!! My veggie burger was super tender and had a unique flavor and to my surprise extremely tasty! I stuffed it with sweet potato and guac with ketchup and it turned out perfect for me..! It was a very good portion size too. They serve you drinks in souvenir cups that say Oasis tx etc. sadly I forgot to take mine!

It consists of four stories I believe.  They must have hundreds of workers being that there's a good bit of indoor and outdoor seating.  Being that this place is so big and crowded, I'm sure the servers get overwhelmed all the time, which causes the service to be very lacking, as we had first-hand experience.

So we came to this romantic place with my husband to watch the sunset and have a dinner. We had some chips, made an order and went to take some pictures with the nice view of Lake Travis. When we came back after couple minutes, another couple was sitting on our table and there wasn't our water cups and chips on the table anymore. It appeared, they assumed that we left (it was no more then 2-3 minutes that we've been gone). So we explained the situation to that couple and sit back to our table. So, then we've been sitting with the empty table and couldn't catch any waiter to ask about what's going with our food, since they assumed we were gone. It took sometime. After all they brought us our dishes, but cilantro was all over the place and I specifically asked not to have cilantro anywhere close to my food. So we had to call for a manager. She came to ask after sometime, listened to all the situation, politely tried to solve the situation. After all they gave us complimentary hot tea and dessert. I really appreciated the gesture of a manager, but to be honest, all the food is so bad quality, not delicious and pricey. The dessert were fine by the way.

A \"runner\" came by with an extra cup for my 1 year old so I asked again if we could get some ranch and she said \" You will have to ask your server because that's not something I do\". I was very caught off guard by that. Even if you don't do that or it's not in your \"job description\", if she had good customer service skills she would have said something like \" absolutely, no problem\" left and told our server. Basically it felt like \"hey, not my job\". Needless to say by the time we were done with our meal the ranch came. But we sent it back because we obviously didn't need it.

I went with the Pollo Ranchero, a grilled chicken breast smothered in \"ranchero sauce\" on a bed of rice and beans on the side. When the beans are the best part of the meal, you know you're in trouble. The chicken had clearly been frozen - probably for several days, and the \"ranchero sauce\" couldn't have been anything more than some ketchup with some chopped peppers. All this for $15.25. The three folks with us who had margaritas also said they were weak. It's a shame that a place in such a good location can't serve up something better.\n\nService wasn't the best in the world, but it was pretty good considering the crowd.

It has an amazing view of Lake Travis and the sunset was beautiful.  I had the burger and fries and my husband had the shrimp tacos.  Both dishes were really good and the queso appetizer was good as well.  Don't let the wait scare you away because they had stuff to do while you waited.  There is a gift shop, a boot shop, and an arcade along with lots of outdoor seating.  They had plenty of parking but you can do valet for only $5.

Their party arrived at the restaurant and was told that if they wanted to sit on the patio to watch the sunset it was a first come, first serve basis and had to find a table for themselves. \n\nThe hostess told them to stand by a table until they left that turned into an argument with another group who had been waiting for that same table and was obviously uncomfortable for the people at that table.\n\nThe waitstaff never greeted them, gave them a menu, or took their drink order for over an hour. They had to track down a waiter, named JP who was extremely rude. He told them that he was sat with ten tables at once and that he didn't care, \"Where you're from, who you are and what you want.\" And when asked for a manager he flatly refused saying that they were \"on their own\" and didn't know where a manager was nor was he going to find one.\n\nThey did eventually have a waiter named William who took their order. It took over an hour for them to get their food and he forgot my sister's order. When it finally arrived :30 minutes later it was cold. Afterwards when he brought their bill, it took him another :30 minutes to run it.\n\nShe finally found a manager. He said that he would take care of it and never came back. This is the most appalling experience and the most disgusting service I have ever heard, yet despite all this they still tipped the waiter. Why I don't know.

I haven't been back to Austin since 2001 (right before my family and I moved to California from Houston).\n\nSeeing that The Oasis currently has 2.5 stars and reading others' reviews, I was a bit hesitant on coming. What if the food was absolutely not worth your money?? We would have wasted our time waiting, you know? People obviously come here for the views. I wanted to give the food a shot.\n\nWe waited about 30 min to be seated. While waiting, we walked around to find a perfect spot to take pictures and enjoy the view. We accomplished that task pretty quickly and I was over the heat already. We went back inside and found seats in the a/c. We got seated down on the lowest level and the first table against the edge. Perfect seats, perfect view... but I was sweating the entire time. There were two fans above us, but of course with my luck, they were blowing air the opposite direction. When the sun begins to set, the staff take down the umbrellas. At first, I was like, nooooo. the sun! But as soon as they did that, I felt the light breeze come through.\n\nThey give water and chips shortly after you get seated. I ordered beef fajitas and my bf ordered chicken enchiladas. The food is good!! Not amazing, but still very good! My boyfriend ordered their spicy banana pina colada or whatever. He said he thought he read in the menu that the cup it comes in (for alcohol) is complimentary, buuuut not 100% sure. \n\nFour stars because the service was below average. Our waitress forgot our water pitcher, food took a while to arrive, forgot our to-go container, and was pretty much non-existent. I understand it's a very busy restaurant, but I'd expect to have impeccable service seeing how popular the place is.\n\nI would come back again, though.", "date": "2017-06-12 14:36:13"}

They were also VERY accommodating to our request for us to be moved to another table for we got an area where there was no parasol to protect us from the glaring sun.

I think the kitchen put more effort into their foods for Mother's Day but that effort was too much as my mom and I noted that they had seasoned the chicken with TOO much pepper. The chicken and beef tasted so dry and flavorless. My dad was picking at the sides (seasoned vegetables, onions, etc) and also noted that those were the highlight of the meal.

Or at least that's how I described it recently to a group of doubtful friends from out of town. They were sold on it once we arrived. No cotton candy necessary.\n\nThe restaurant itself is worth a quick tour, but be advised that the food is fairly pricey and well-known to be average in quality, and that there will usually be a looong wait to get in.  If you see a long line snaking into the parking lot, you know you're in the right place. A lot of people just go for drinks, appetizers, and the sunset (applause is obligatory, but after a couple of drinks, you will totally join in).\n\nDownstairs is an interesting covered patio section (Starlight Lounge) that has a cover band and appetizers and drinks most evenings of the week. The wait may be shorter for this section, but be advised that most of it doesn't really include a clear lake view, if that's what you came out for. \n\nThe complex around it has some interesting local shops with one-of-a-kind items, and the center offers a wine taste & tour once a month for a nominal fee that benefits a charity. There's also a coffee shop and a fro-yo place downstairs. So if you arrive and are daunted  by the wait, you can always walk around and have a coffee or a fro-yo. There's a catwalk to the right of the restaurant that offers a nice perch for a photo op. You can also view from a distance the owner's castle home adjacent to the complex. Is there no limit to this man's wealth and creativity?\n\nI used to recommend that people skip over to Uncle Billy's instead (better food, same view), but their website says they're closed for the season (winter).

We had fajitas this time and they were a little tough and wanting of a little more seasoning. The chips and salsa were good. Someone got a fried shrimp app that was very tasty, actually. The view of Lake Travis is phenomenal right now with all the rains filling up the lake (imagine seeing ugly dirt islands in the middle of the lake when the water level is low). \n\nBut what people really need to know is that our meal out on the balcony felt horrible today. There was a constant barrage of \"No-see-ums\" (aka biting midges, sandfly/sandfleas) hitting everybody at our table and all nearby tables. We could see everybody scratching and swatting at themselves. The word \"swarm\" would not be an understatement with how it felt to be outside today. You can't see them on you, but we managed to see some that got stuck on the white cups (see pic). The staff informed us of what they were and insisted there was nothing they could do for us other than to keep the fans on. Their gift shop offers homeopathic style (herb oils, non-DEET) insect repellant, but it did not work for us. I had a 15% DEET spray but even that didn't completely fix the nuisance. I don't know what the answer is, but they need to find a better way to combat the infestation before leaving customers outside to be bitten by bugs that are blood-sucking, and can often harbor numerous disease-causing viruses/microbes (much like mosquitoes). The staff insisted they can't spray for these because of their proximity to the lake. I'm skeptical but I'll take their word for it until I hear otherwise. More info for the curious - \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratopogonidae\n\nI hate mosquitoes. These Noseeums are worse than mosquitoes, more aggressive and incessant.

If you want good food, downtown Austin in 30 minutes away.\n\nMy Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\n\nAtmosphere - The Oasis on Lake Travis has more of a theme park feel than a cozy restaurant.  There's now a huge multi-level parking complex, valet parking, shopping, and multiple restaurants/floors with live music on most nights.  Oh year, it also happens to overlook the west side of Lake Travis, meaning if you're here during the evening you may get a spectacular view.  I don't know how much I want to stress this, it's an awesome view.  And if you've come all this way, this is what you want to experience.  1 Star.\n\nService - I was here for a private party and we had a dedicated space with our own staff.  They were extremely nice and helpful, doing everything from managing the bar, coordinating dinner, and of course serving our dinner.  Not sure what service is like in the normal restaurant by my experience was great. 1 Star.\n\nFood - We had a catered dinner that consisted of a great, nicely seasoned shrimp cocktail along with a fried snapper with salad.  Who am I kidding, the food was good but not great.  Again, understand you're here for the view, and if you really are here for the food someone has tricked you.  1/2 Star.\n\nWill I Return? - Only with other tourists.  The Oasis on Lake Travis is a GREAT location to visit if you want to wow someone with a great view.  Throw in live music & a party atmosphere and it should make any tourist happy.  I would take my out of state relatives here.  I would come for a private party, but I would never come here on my own if food was the reason why.  Keep that in mind if you ever visit.   1/2 Star.\n\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \n\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.", "date": "2014-10-02 03:23:12"}

One suggestion was for The Oasis.  I had to interject.  \"Go fed\" I said, and I couldn't have meant it more sincerely.\n\nThe Oasis boasts a fabulous view.  This is absolutely true; the view is gorgeous as the sun is setting.  It's also true that the food is nasty, and overpriced.

When I wrote my intial review, The Oasis was such a splendid place.  So very unique.  So very relaxing.  So very Austin.  And in less than a year, you've decimated it.  Now...so very touristy.  To the point to where I feel compelled to vent.\n\nSee Beau, the food & drinks were never very good.  But it wasn't just the view that made me excuse it, it was this whole feel of community that the restaurant had with the open main deck, the outdoor stage, the multilevel mini-decks.  But you apparently never understood why you were so successful.  Otherwise, you would never close the main deck to put in...let me get this straight...shops.  Retail.  And you build these admittedly beautiful but souless inside (yes, not outside but inside) decks that are open to the outdoors and think we're going to all get the same vibe?   Now...it just feels like a Disney-esque representation of what it was.\n\nInstead of letting the setting and the landscape speak for itself, everything is stone and  fake hit-you-over-the-head Tuscan.  This is  some misguided brainstorm you've had, Beau.  It's as if you're wanting to sink to the worst shallow self-indulgent tendencies of the SoCal invaders.  \"Please, SoCal dumb asses.  Please come to this place where everything is as fake and shallow as the place you fled.\"  Before, I felt proud to show people this unique place that they couldn't find anywhere else.   Now I feel like I should be shuttling them through the gift shop to buy trinkets on the way out.\n\nBeau: your food sucks.  Your tequila sucks.  Your wait staff is friendly, but slow.  And now, the one thing you had going for you, your atmosphere, feels like Orlando.  For all the good you have done in the past, living in the midst of wannabe druglord homes has apparently done you a disservice, and therefore Austin a huge disservice.  I think the fire took more than some of your decks in the hill; it apparently took your soul.\n\nBut I don't have to support that.  And I shall not be back.", "date": "2008-07-12 00:22:17"}

They even decorated for the holidays with 3 Christmas trees that happened to be in the same colors as the reception (cranberry red, aquamarine blue and silver).  Lucky me!  We also had some specific requests afer the food tasting (such as making sure the brisket was not dry) and lo and behold, the brisket was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  The appetizer of chicken diablos were a big hit and vanished rather quickly.  The chicken was delicious as was the grilled asparagus.  The cheesy scalloped potatoes could have been a little softer, but they did get softer with time.  The ranch beans were really yummy too.  Overall it was a magical day for us!  The location, venue's beauty, staff, service and food really came together to make our reception truly memorable.  Thank you Kelsey and the Oasis!", "date": "2012-12-19 07:31:00"}

As far as the food and service maybe, just maybe one star. We arrived at 2:30 pm and we're planning on a late lunch. We ordered a round of drinks and appetizers. For appetizers we ordered chicken balls and shrimp of some form. The first round of drinks came out fairly fast, as did complimentary chips and salsa. As far as a second round of drinks...not so much. I went to the bar and got them myself. At 3:15 pm we still had no appetizers in sight, nor a waitress. So I went to a manager to explain to him the key element to a great dining experience is service. He seemed to miss that point in our discussion. So the appetizers finally arrived and I've had better happy meals. My best advice is to enjoy the view and drinks. Don't expect much more.", "date": "2017-11-26 01:03:49"}

I had the joy of going to the Oasis about 4 years ago and it was a great experience. I was excited to repeat the sentiment, and was sorely disappointed. The view was equally as beautiful as four years ago, however with multiple sacrifices. First the parking situation was a sorry attempt for all I can assume is population control. With two surface lots and a garage parking it was still a farce. We arrived and after waiting in line for 30 minutes were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait. Ok, no problem, to be expected. Then we went next door to the Oasis Brewery (saved for a later review). I must say the shopping area has grown with much diversity and things to do while you wait for your highly anticipated table. After exactly an hour and a half we were escorted to our table. The service was a far cry from desirable. While our waitress tried desperately, she was overworked with far too many tables. Our food was served cold after a 45 minute wait. I was also told there were no knifes available for my chicken. Our highly anticipated dinner was a sorry experience with Cisco food, BUT there was a view.

The veggie burger with sweet potato fries seemed to get the best review. Nearly the whole table got the veggie burger. I was expecting it to be pretty rough, but surprisingly it wasn't bad. It wasn't anything memorable, nothing I would go back for, but it wasn't awful. The food was subpar, the burger was a bean burger with other spices and mix ins. The bun was nice and flavorful. Others at the table got the house salad with chicken. They said it was nothing special, they got it because it was hard to mess up. The chicken was interesting, but not something to throw out. \nOtherwise, the chips and salsa were pretty phenom, I loved the spice to the salsa and it was awesome. \nIf you Go, waste money on drinks, not the food. \n\nSERVICE : Definitely was not a fan of the service. We had a waitress that was unattentive, snippy, and had a poor attitude. We were lucky to get our waters filled up more than once, she rolled her eyes if we asked for something, and she had an attitude with every response. Poor poor service, but they know people will come because the view is unreal. Laaaame. \n\nATMOSPHERE : This place is beautiful. Absolutely, 100% beautiful. The view makes you feel like you're looking out at the ocean in Italy. It is magnificence, phenomenal. Two people got engaged in the 2 hours we were there! Here's the bad part. This place is dirty.

Garbage was over flowing floors needed to be swept.  I can see the inside of the kitchen while walking into our eating area and the floor was filthy.   I mean come on people if the health department walk through you so would be closed down then and there.  It was hazardous not just for their guest. But employees as well.   \n\nWe only ordered dessert because my friends mom said don't waste you money on the food.  We took her advice to par and didn't order a meal.  Prices were about average. We ordered the cheesecake, chocolate torte and the ice cream.  It was not bad.  How can you mess up pre made desserts?   It was not bad.  Taste as good as costco cheese cake.  I had a plastic cup of ice water which the waiter brought out 20 for like 11 people.  He told use to stay hydrated because it was hot outside.  Well at 7pm. It's not so hot anymore.   Thank for your thoughtfulness.   They had fans, mist fan and more to cook down the deck area.  Along with like 150 umbrellas.   Which the waiter took down 15 min before the sunset.  The umbrellas thrown in the back like they were a bouncy ball that would land softly.   That really showed me no pride in company property.  \n\nOne thing I didn't like was the sun glared so strong on the lake water.  You can get a sun tan on your face. Lol.  I kept my back facing the lake.  This lake water is very low.  I think it's more like 25% filled. I felt bad as I looked at the banks of the lake more than 50 ft away from the water.  The drought has affected this lake as well.  \n\nIf you are a sunset lover. Visit this place order something to drink stay and watch the sunset.  Be prepared to wait for seats.  Which I didn't understand because there were 3 sections of seating that were empty.  \n\n1 star for not so bad dessert. \n1 star for sunset.\n0 star for service\n0 star for bathrooms\n0 star for facilities cleanliness.", "date": "2014-09-02 03:10:46"}

Shockingly small selection of tex-mex fare at outrageously high prices (think Fonda San Miguel level) but with Taco Bell taste, if you are lucky.   This is a great place to take out of towners, especially those who don't live somewhere with great tex-mex or who have never been to the Texas hill country.  They won't know that the food sucks and they will absolutely adore you for the scenic drive out there and the heart stopping view and sunset.  The building itself is vastly improved after being rebuilt after the fire, although the collection of statues has become more of an obsession now.   Seriously, how many people in the world can there be who are looking to purchase a giant bronze statue of monkeys doing see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil?   I'd guess that it is less than the number of testicles on my body.\n\nFood selection is piss poor at best and will leave you wishing you just had a few beers.   Actually, the queso with guacamole and meat was pretty good, but queso is pretty much impossible to mess up.   I tried the shrimp diablo last night - butterflied shrimp stuffed with a jalapeno slice.  I'd bet one of my previously mentioned testicles that they were Cisco frozen style, and they were still totally overcooked and tough as leather.  The bed of rice tasted like it was cooked in the ocean.  How much salt can someone put in a serving of rice!?  Fajitas were fair.   \n\nMargaritas are mostly frozen, but you can request on the rocks, which clearly are made with a mix rather than fresh lime and hand shaking, as they should be at these prices.   Bottled beers are good though.   Service was OK but slow.   I guess I can't blame them with the number of people and levels of decking.\n\nA light bulb just went on in my head - my solution to the Oasis (besides don't go)...

The guest service desk was very rude and not willing to asssit. We had asked if they could see how much longer our wait would be and the response we received was there are 600 people on this list. So there is no way for me to look you up. Like what kind of a system  and service is that in which you can't provide an update to your guest.  The hostess outside was way nicer and helpful. \n\nFor such a huge place they do not have enough restrooms like why would people have to wait 10 min on line to use the restroom. \n\nThe food at this place is not even worth going for or waiting over an hour and half for as it is sub par and has no quality to its food.

Normally I don't like to use harsh words but she got the orders wrong and didn't give anyone the correct items we ordered. She kept handing off the dishes and drinks by one end of the table instead of individually handing each person their order. She charged us for something we didn't get and was confused when we asked her why we were charged twice. She didn't even place one of the dish orders and when we sent the bill back to get updated she forgot to bring back an updated check. Also she only checked up on us every 45-60 min.  How would we ever be able to get refill and such as there were no other waiter or waitresses working in the vacinity either. \n\nThe outdoor seating is even a longer wait and honestly I don't think it's worth it.

For the first time, I chose to forgo my usual chicken dish and try the enchiladas. They were awful. The whole plate was cold, the chicken had no flavor and it was just bad. I set the plate off to the side of me after moving the food around a bit and having only two-three bites. She came by several times and glanced at our table often but never once did she make mention of the food being untouched. Didn't even offer a box to take it home. Needless to say, we were charged for the enchiladas.

It's like casual upscale, if that makes any sense. The location is pretty nice, and the views really are that nice. If you can get there in time for the sunset, then it's pretty cool. In fact a lot of people, especially those who've been drinking, will applaud at the sunset, which is amusing. \n\nThe food I didn't think was really *that* bad. Apparently it used to be a lot worse years ago, but then they switched the cooks and when I was there last I didn't have any real complaints. It is a little overpriced for the quality of what you're getting, but it ain't horrible. I forget the name of the dish I had, but it was like their most expensive thing only because I don't go there often at all. It was like 25 bucks and it had some steak, shrimp, fish and shrimp; I thought it was decent enough.\n\nI haven't been here in like a year and a half, but last I went they were doing a ton of construction, like expanding the restaurant (which already sits like 1,000 people altogether or something ridiculous), putting in parking garages and adding in this art gallery or something. I'm sure they're done with most of it, and someone who knows can elaborate on that, but I believe they're trying to make it into this big artsy area where people can sell their artwork or something. \n\nIn short, the food is decent and kind of expensive, but it is a great place to have drinks with friends, enjoy the view and chill.

Beatles cover on Fridays, rocks on Saturdays, Latin on Sundays. Great for kids too, especially on Friday nights when the music is more family-oriented. I love seeing my 4-yr old son dancing with the little kids to Beatles music.\n\nHere are the major cons:\n- Food is not worth the cost\n- Too crowded, especially on the weekend\n- Parking is almost impossible\n\nThe Oasis is 5 min from my house and I used to go there every weekend. I tried almost everything on the menu to justify having dinner there but have long given up. I cannot find anything that's worth having there for the cost. So we ended up eating dinner somewhere else and going there for drinks only (which are pretty decent).\n\nHowever, ever since they turned the whole Oasis area into a mini shopping mall, parking (which was pretty bad before) has become impossible. They built a 4-floor garage which still barely holds the popular traffic there. The last couple of times we tried to go to the Oasis on a weekend, we could not find parking anywhere so we ended up going somewhere else. \n\nI am sad.

I live in the Lake Travis area, and I have a similar view to The Oasis every evening, so I'm not impressed by it.  That said, it is a pleasant enough looking place, somewhat of a monstrous building perched atop a west-facing hill.  It tends to be noisy and touristy-crowded on the weekends.\n\nI visited with a couple of friends and shared out orders of Chipotle Baby Back Ribs, the 'Big Ol' Burger', and the 'Texas Red Fish'. The Baby Backs were so-so; I could get similar flavors from warming up a slab of pre-cooked ribs from H-E-B. The burger was 'meh' and certainly no bargain compared to Whataburger. The fish was the real kicker. 'Redfish' implies that you're getting some variant of Red Snapper, or Red Drum.  However, a careful read of the menu shows that it's Texas 'Red' Fish.\n\nWhen I asked about this, I was informed that this referred to the recipe, which made the whitefish used 'reddish'. After tasting the result, I'm thinking that one of the two restaurant-trade staples of cheap basa or tilapia were used.  I could live with that.  But the flavor...yeah, something was definitely 'off'.  No one got sick, but the consensus was that this was a fillet that had been stuck at the back of the freezer, got freezer-burned, and was brought out at the last minute.  Truly awful.\n\nIf you must come, come for the view and after-dinner drinks.\n\nThis place gets only 1 star on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.\n\n5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing on after finishing a meal here.\n4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary.\n3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good.

We were seated in the sun, but that's ok, at that time of day, the sun shifts quickly, so I knew we would be in the shadows soon.\n\nWe were in the shadows by the time the server bothered to come see us. I believe her name was Kenyanna? Anyway, we had enough time to choose our drinks and entrees before she even came by to say she would \"be right back.\" Well thank God that she was kind enough to come back 5 minutes after that with some water. Then she promptly took our drink orders and left, we had to stop her to order an appetizer (you have got to be kidding me) ... Anyway, the appetizer came soon enough, but she let us all go dry in our drinks and our waters. Way to go, I have a 2 year old, and its SO easy to deal with a thirsty two year old. \n\nOur appetizer was gone before she bothered to take our entree order. The food came, and since this is the Oasis, and they don't have to focus on food quality or service for customers, it tasted mediocre at best. The chicken enchiladas are tasteless, and the beef fajitas probably barely get any attention.\n\nAnyway we didn't see her again until she delivered the check. We had to stop other people to get water refills (no way we were going to run up the tab on drinks like we planned to at this point). Wouldn't you know it, at group of 7 is big enough for auto-gratuity.

It was for a birthday dinner and since we are from Florida, I figured the views would be worth the trip to The Oasis for dinner anyway. We arrived around 6pm on Saturday May 12th, 2018 and were promptly placed on a 1.5 hour wait. We anticipated this so it wasn't an issue. We went to the brewery upstairs and enjoyed some pre dinner cocktails. My party was sat right around the hour and a half mark. We immediately ordered cocktails and appetizers. We were forewarned that the kitchen was slightly backed up but our apps and drinks arrived very quickly. I can't remember the name of the appetizer but it was bacon wrapped chicken smothered in some kind of bbq sauce and accompanied by a jalape\u00f1o ranch. OMG, they were delicious. There were five people in our party and we all enjoyed our main meals. My husband got the chicken/steak fajita while I ordered the fish tacos with rice and black beans. All the food was flavorful, especially the beans. As a Puerto Rican, I enjoy a particularly good batch of beans and although it may be weird to comment on something so specific as beans, I must say they were my favorite! I could have eaten a bowl of the black beans by themselves HAHA. Anyway, I always believe in trying a place despite negative reviews and I'm so happy we did. I had a colleague from work visiting Austin the same weekend who bailed on The Oasis based on the reviews. After I sent her pictures and my approval of the food, she was upset of her decision. She is making plans to go back soon and will add this to her list. I say give this place a try and worst case scenario, you'll enjoy some great cocktails with an amazing view.", "date": "2018-05-15 02:46:47"}

Honestly, this place seems to get worse. Called ahead for reservations, which they wouldn't take. Thankfully, it wasn't busy at all. We were a party of 8 -  6 kids and 2 adults. 4 of the kids were 16 so I asked for 2 tables of 4 outside with a view. They said they might not be able to get the tables beside each other and I said ok. (I assumed they would try their best and get them as close as possible, but I was wrong). We walk outside and although there are tables with a beautiful view, they don't seat either table there. They bring us off to the side and have the teenagers sit really far away from us, even though they had so many tables available. Both tables had a view of just trees. I didn't ask to sit outside in 100 degree weather for a view of trees. I had to ask 3 times for a different table. Again, there was plenty availability and it was near others, so it wasn't an issue of no servers there. \nOnce we finally got seated (again I can't even see our other table) the server sucked. Makes sense why at a busy lunch time that this place wasn't busy at all. It was an act of congress to get our drinks refilled, we ordered queso and a refill of chips didn't come until after our food arrived, so our queso was cold. The only good thing about this place is the view, that is IF they want to give you a table with a view. The food was ok. I ordered a chicken salad on top of avocado and spinach. It said it had black beans, but I think it literally only had 4 black beans in it. Lol.

My veggie burger ranked among the worst I've consumed and the fries were limp and semi-warm. My out-of-town guest was equally displeased with her cheeseburger. Our waiter could not have been more disinterested in us (okay, we're boring...fair enough), and the prices are ridiculous for the food-to-dollar ratio.\n\nI give Oasis three stars for the concept, the indoor/outdoor seating, the free plastic cup keepsake, the matchbooks & mints, and yes....the view.\n\nOasis = Overrated.", "date": "2006-11-21 16:38:46"}

It was raining a little bit.  Finally we got there, and the hostess (expression-less, no smile) took us to our seat.  And we asked for the lounge seat, because we wanted to sit outside, DUH!\nI know that everyone goes there for view.  Anyways, she put us right next to a group of people when there were so many empty seats.. \nWe had to say excuse us so many times to get into our seats.\nThe chairs were squeezed tightly together, so it wasn't convenient.\nThe fan, which was on , was right above our heads, making sooo much noise, that our waiter couldn't even hear me ordering.  While we were eating, dust from the fan fell on our table.  You have no idea how bad it feels.  We wanted to switch our table, but I didn't want to make no scene!! \nThe food , the most important, probably more important than atmosphere, was BADDDDD! Overpriced, not so many choices either.  The guacamole was so little portioned, for 6.95.  It was in a little bowl, probably smaller than a rice bowl which you could see if you go to a japanese restaurant. And there was chopped lettuce hiding under guacamole, so basically the real avocado portion was sooooooooooooooo small.  The entree I ordered, Mahi with chile and pineapple sauce with some spanish rice and veggie, BAD! the fish was overcooked, dry, badly seasoned, and the veggies were so bitter for some reason.  \nwe had a good service though, since he checked on us twice or three times while we were eating.  the drinks were filled promptly, and he didn't rush us to finish eating.  \nOur check wasn't that big, because we only had one app. and one entree.  But still, I couldn't stop thinking that the foods are overpriced.  \nAbsolutely, the view is good, but it is a restaurant.

Then my daughter wanted bean and cheese nachos. Again, you would think that's something easy. They managed to butcher the nachos. The nachos were presented with all sorts of junk piled on top. Okay, easy enough to remove what we didn't want, but then I noticed the beans. The put WHOLE pinto beans on the chips. Just scattered about and covered with very little cheese. Living in different parts of Texas my whole life, I have never seen anyone put whole pinto beans on nachos. In Texas, it's refried beans!! Then I noticed that the beans that came with the fajitas were also whole pinto beans. Again, not what you normally seen as the beans that come with fajitas. I asked our server why they used whole pinto beans. She said that this is a different kind of restaurant. I told her that it's unfortunately they have chosen to make their nachos as if we are in the north east. She then admitted that they don't have any retried beans!!!! What??? You have a lot of tex-mex items on the menu and no refried beans??  Good grief.

I sent out messages to about 20 restaurants and The Oasis event staff was the easiest to work with. They immediately reached out and sent me an email with all of the information laid out. They gave me a lot to work with on a menu and let me customize exactly what I wanted as long as I reached the minimum per person. I got the Lone Star Room with a private balcony at sunset and the views were STUNNING. The Oasis staff did a wonderful job providing my linens of choice and having fresh flower centerpieces on each table. We had a private bar and bartender for my guests. They also have a sound system and a way to show a slideshow to your guests. While there they were able to accommodate adding a few extra food selections on the spot. It was the easiest experience when it came to wedding planning. It was all taken care of for me and they were more than happy to do it. I highly recommend for a couple looking for a rehearsal dinner space. You already have so much to figure out, this should be the easy part. I should also add that they are on top of their security. We had a random party crasher that was an issue and we had a police officer present within five minutes. My guests were not disturbed and it was handled discreetly. We could not be happier with our experience at The Oasis and if we ever have another dinner party in Austin we will definitely be calling them up again.", "date": "2017-11-14 14:44:19"}

Its just not how I was raised to complain, but dang, this place was bad.\n\nTHE FOOD:::\nThere were three of us, and we disliked everything we got; The spicy chicken sandwich was neither spicy, nor good. It was bland, too thick for the seasoning method (imagine 1 1/4 inches of un-seasoned white meat) and came with maybe half a teaspoon of the jalapeno ranch (i ordered more, but when it came it wasn't spicy either, and even when I added it to the burger, the burger still managed to be the blandest chicken sandwich ever). The pretzel bun was good though. The burger was not excessively large, but I did not finish it, opting instead to go back to eating the chips and salsa rather than force it down.\n\nThe Taos burgher was spicier than the chicken sandwich, but still not deserving a spicy tag (it didn't have one, but it made me more upset that my spicy chicken sandwich was bland). The mushrooms didn't work for any of us, and the burger was cooked wrong. House fries were good.\n\nThe veggie fajitas were not good. The spice was off and made everything taste cloyingly sweet. We asked for a to go plate for it because my GF couldn't eat it and we didn't want to leave a full plate on the table. \n\nThe perfect margarita wasn't great. IDK what to say about this, I think its subjective; My mother-in -law thought it needed more tequila, I thought it needed less. Probably don't judge the drink on this review for that reason.\n\nTHE RESTAURANT:::\nCame for the view, waited for the deck, spent 45 minutes staring at the crowd of people between me and the lake. Crowded does not begin to sum it up. Mother in law went down to the edge of the deck to see the water, was asked to return to her table by a server. I got upset when I realized there were 5 tables at the edge of the deck that were empty, and never got filled, but that they shoved me against a wall with no view of the lake.\n\nService was slow, like really slow. Place was hot, but not unbearably so, because they had fans and a lot of umbrellas (those made it hard to move around though). Most telling was the fact that the table next to ours had their deserts comped because they never got their food, and when a server noticed that none of us had finished our food and we all looked dissatisfied she very helpfully offered to send over a manager. I looked up and noticed that there were three managers, each talking to different tables. They all looked like they were apologizing, and we just decided that we didn't want to be there any more. We just paid our bill and left. The only thing we finished from the whole meal was my firemans 4.  \n\nThe Bill: $63\nShould have cost: $25", "date": "2018-05-27 13:51:39"}

The restaurant itself is MASSIVE!  And it has amazing views.  There are lots of employees and the service was pretty good.\n\nHere's the not so good stuff.  The food was mediocre. Not a whole lot of flavor.  I thought Texas is known for having good Tex Mex, but this place does it no justice. Then lets take a closer look at the appearance of this place, its kinda run down.  Torn booths, dirty floors, worn out tables.  Looks like they just don't maintain this place.  Now the view is also great looking out at the lake, but don't look straight down.  The cliff is full of trash!  I mean come on, your patrons are going to see that, spend some money to keep that area clean.  I understand its probably hard to clean on a cliff, but if you chose to build a restaurant there, then you should be ready to deal with the headaches involving the up keep in and around.\n\nOverall, don't go here if your going for food and view.  I didn't try Soliel next door but you can and see if its any better.  The place looks like it probably gets very busy in the summers by people who want to drink and party while on the lake.  So I'm sure thats a good thing to do there, otherwise, probably not worth going to.", "date": "2013-03-05 19:42:04"}

So we went down to The Oasis. \n\n~SERVICE~\n* The greeter was really friendly and welcomed us nicely\n* We were told that a table for 5 would be at least a thirty minute wait, but, like amusement parks, the wait was shorter and turned out to be 5 minutes\n* Our waiter, Moe, was nice enough but seemed pretty tired\n* The guy who brought out our food with Moe was really gruff and not nice at all\n* The food came at a good time; not too early, not too late\n| 3 stars |\n\n~ATMOSPHERE~\n* This place is fun\n* It reminds me of an amusement park restaurant (not sure if that's good or bad, though)\n* It is very loud and surprisingly dark once the sun sets\n* People are noticeably drunk; not in-your-face drunk, more playful\n| 4 stars |\n\n~FACILITY~\n* It definitely isn't In-N-Out regarding cleanliness\n* There were forks and pieces of chips littering the ground around the tables\n* Great view, but you can only see it well if you go out to the balcony, which is quite crowded\n* Great decorations and building\n| 4.5 stars |\n\n~FOOD~\n* First of all, my siblings were there and had the kids menus, which weren't very creative (see pictures)\n* The regular menu has about 20 entrees, none of which are super original\n* We had just regular chips and salsa. Let me just say that the chips honestly seemed like they warmed up a bag of Tostitos and dumped it in a basket\n* The salsa was good, although I couldn't tell how real it was. It tasted roasted, which personally I like\n* I got the chipotle ribs. They had good flavor, although they were massively overdone or something. The bark was too thick, the meat was near impossible to get off the bone, and personally I would have enjoyed a steak knife to break them apart. They came with coleslaw, which was mediocre, and sweet potato fries that were drizzled with honey\n| 2 stars |\n\n~DRINK~\n* You have to ask for water\n* My mom got a pi\u00f1a colada and said it was good, but way too sweet\n* My siblings got Shirley Temples, which had barely any grenadine in them\n* Every single drink came in these dumb plastic cups. Even my mom's pi\u00f1a colada came in a smaller plastic cup. At a restaurant, I want to drink from a glass\n| 2.5 stars |\n\n~PRICE~\n* Way too overpriced. I think they increased the prices since the other reviewers were here, too\n* $9 for guacamole OR qu\u00e9so is way too much\n| 0 stars |\n\n~VERDICT~\nAll in all, I think that everyone should come here at least once because it's a staple of Lake Travis. Yes, the views are nice, but you'll get an even better one (and better everything), if you go upstairs to the Tavern. And if you want to get away from the crowds, then go a few miles down the shore to Rough Hollow's club restaurant. It has free valet parking, too; it's view is almost as nice as The Oasis. This whole experience really gave me a Disneyland vibe: long lines, a million tables, tired staff, subpar food, and royally expensive. But, like Disneyland, kids will love this place (it even has a small arcade).\n\n{2.66 stars total}", "date": "2016-08-21 03:40:25"}

It was literally the worst experience at a restaurant I've ever had. I normally give a lot of leeway for restaurants because it is a tough gig dealing with shitty people who only like to complain & ask how long til they are seated & almost make the hostess want to throw themselves over a balcony ledge with a rope tied around their neck. I get that. I've been there. Granted it was a holiday weekend so expected wait times are higher. I get that too. What I don't get is having a group of 8 forgotten, even with those handy dandy vibrating table buzzers (that I was real excited to use). We were at the 2 hour mark when a server on her smoke break informed us that the bars were closing. Confused & starving we said we were still waiting to be sat. She disappeared. She came back from the maze that is this restaurant & told us to immediately go to the hostess desk. At this point we were all excited to finally get our mediocre, mass produced \"Mexican\" food until we realized the rest of the restaurant was closing up. I asked if we had been forgotten which I was promptly told \"no we were just about to seat you\". We were the last group sat, even though I know there was a Disneyworld attraction line behind us when we first waited to get our names on the list. I checked my phone at 10:20 pm & checked the oasis website which then told me they had closed at 10pm. We ordered some drinks & guac appetizer which took 20 minutes to get to our table even though we were the last ones. At this point we were all hysterical & pretty pissed off that the incompetent staff had forgot to seat us, that we were not holding back with our sarcasm of how great the food was going to be with the cooks spit in it because we were sat after the kitchen was closed. That guac was a melon baller size of slimy avocado & my chicken enchiladas we subpar & barely luke warm. Needless to say that was the first & last Time I (& I'm sure my family's as well) will ever visit that shithole restaurant with a great view.", "date": "2015-09-07 10:30:39"}

The Oasis reminds me of a mythical castle suspended above the hills and the lake like a fortress. A \"Hogwarts on Lake Travis\", if you will. Go simply to experience one of the most breathtaking locations of almost any restaurant I've ever seen. There are over 800 tables at this place! Hands down the largest restaurant I've ever seen - when you drive by, you may mistake the Oasis for a casino-resort, as I did. Think again.\n\nLike Amy B. commented, the food here was not outstanding and was rather over-priced ($18-23 for an entree) for roughly the quality of your average Red Robin. I guess you really are paying for the spectacular views. Their drinks, however, are quite good and will satisfy ever the biggest margarita snobs. Their Gold and Guava varieties are the best.\n\nI visited The Oasis after taking a red-eye the previous night into Austin. As a first-time visitor to the state of Texas and the city of Austin, I was blown away by the natural beauty of Lake Travis and the stunning location of The Oasis.

The red sauce on them was even nastier. I still stand by El Borrego as my go to place for low priced and good enchiladas. I did love the chips and dip they served us. And they give you a BIG container of dip to take home along with chips for FREE. That was pretty shocking but I was glad because that dip is awesome. I also ordered some sort of strawberry cheesecake and I must say that was delicious but overpriced. For $8 bucks they should go all out on the cheesecake. They have this place set up so horribly and what I mean is they have the tables right in front of the fans that are on high power. The chips and everything kept blowing off the table. That makes NO SENSE to have it set up that way. I want to enjoy my food on the table and not on the floor. And by the way there really was no point in having it on because it just blew hot hair. It was so muggy and hot out there. Our waitress Ashley was very nice and attentive. The other waitstaff were also nice. So service, chips and dip, and cheesecake were 5 stars!

The restaurant is huge with so many things to look at/do. \nI would go again for the view and drinks.\n\nMy problems with the restaurant was the service.It wasn't completely horrible, but not very good either. I could tell our waitress had too many tables. Also one of the people I was with got served the wrong dish. When ordering you pick black or charro beans. His entire dish was the wrong one and when he said something to the server the only thing that was offered was \" If you don't like the black beans we can give you charro\". He loves black beans. He didn't cause a fuss and ate the dish he was served anyway. Also another problem was they wouldn't let us split the check in any way. A minor inconvenience. \n\nOverall, we were happy with the taste of our food, they do have a pretty reasonably priced lunch menu. View is amazing.", "date": "2011-01-23 04:29:20"}

I thought Mother's Day 2012 would be a good day to do so, and had already made reservations beforehand.  One word of advice to anyone anywhere...when making reservations to a place you've never been, do the research and ask the questions to find out about prices and if you can get a certain table near where you can actually see the lake, etc..  So we came here and were lucky enough to get parking, so things started off well.  Got to the buffet and they confirmed our reservation and then sat us down out in the open, nowhere near the lakeside views. I won't even say what was up with that, considering they could have sat us in the lakeside view area. My wife kind of didn't like that. Let's just say that for the most part, the food was good. Fruit tasted like it was fresh, the salad was good, the seafood there was good, but probably could have had some better bread. My wife and I took part in both breakfast and lunch that day. The band was playing, but at no time were they introduced so we didn't even know who they were. Then they gave us the bill, and I was pretty inflamed that that it came out to be just under $100 with that 15% or whatever gratuity tacked on. I mean, $34.95 per person for Mother's Day? I am not sure how everyone who had kids was able to eat there today...they must have paid out of their a****! That took away my appetite, and all of a sudden, the food we had eaten didn't taste good anymore. Then they tried to charge us $4 for each mimosa we had, when the bartender himself had said it was a $3 mimosa special. The waitress went to talk to him, then the manager came and in the end, he ended up giving us $2 back in cash because of the misunderstanding. I guess I misunderstood how pricey this place was, and their food was good but it wasn't worth the money we paid, considering we didn't even get a lakeside view. When we left the buffet and walked around the Oasis, it became clear that there were other places we could have eaten, and I felt in general that my wife was saying, \"I told you so!\" in her mind, but sometimes she doesn't always tell me outright, and I know now, for places like this, it's best to just come and walk around and take in the view, and to bring your own food or snacks. There is no justification for paying a 15% gratuity onto a $34.95 per person buffet no matter how great the view is. I honestly have to say, it is the only time we went there, and likely will be the last time we ever go there.", "date": "2012-05-15 15:37:53"}

The views at this venue are beautiful and truly an unique venue overlooking Lake Travis.   I think Oasis would be good for weddings with 150 people or less.  The wedding I attended had over 200 people (from what the bride told me) and it felt cramped.  The layout of the banquet room is long and narrow, with the dance floor in a different room.    We had heavy appetizers at the wedding with wine and beer.   The food left a lot to be desired.  I had high hopes that the less than stellar food I often read about on yelp would have been better for a wedding.  As I was in line to get food, the sliders (which were just hamburgers cut in half) were cold.  How on earth are they going to let cold hamburgers come out of the kitchen?  They also had some cheese, fruits, crackers, queso, spinach dip and quesadilla's.  The food was just kind of blah.  The one shining star was the BBQ bacon wrapped shrimp.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor with the BBQ sauce.   We had a wonderful time with our friends, but I don't think I would recommend Oasis to friends to host their wedding.", "date": "2009-07-15 02:55:17"}

We drove over 45min to get here as we were told the view is amazing but to WatchKit for the food as the quality of their food is very poor.  So we came with no expectation on food quality but were surprised by the poor quality of service and incompetency of management.   We waited one hour to get a table and finally when we were ready to be seated the hostess sat us at a corner in a unventilated and very stuffy and hot area.  We never sat down and went back to the hostess to ask for another seat and she said we had to wait again in the waiting list. She couldn't even put us back into the list and put us at the next available seating. \nAfter her neurons decided to finally fire we sat down at another table.  We sat literally in the middle of 6 other table at the only table that was open in that section. As we were figuring out what to order looking over menu the hostess came back and said sorry we need to move you. We are not going to serve this table anymore.   We asked why and she said we have no one to serve you here.  Yet we were in the middle of the tables that were fully seated.  We asked to speak to a manager and when this amazing gentle man showed up we realized that there is no common sense here.  No apologies and no options to accommodate.   So after a long wait and a long drive we had no choice but to go to another restaurant.  This is a lack of leadership skills and management skills.

Everybody enjoyed their food, I had Texas Red Fish it had a good flavor. Queso was good, I did order the guacamole it was decent but it could use a bit more of flavor. Of course the view was amazing.

Reasons why you should NOT eat here:\n\n- Terrible service. Our server had a bad attitude once she took our order of a few appetizers. We could tell she was upset that we didn't order more, and she spoke to us only once afterwards regarding the check. When we walked up to the host stand there was a very angry man complaining to a manager about the service he had received. \n \n- Disgusting and over priced food. We ordered a few of the brisket flat breads and queso appetizers. The flat bread looked barely thrown together and under cooked. The queso was a very small portion for $8.95 and tasted like Velveeta and Rotel (something we could've thrown together for about half the price)\n\n- Unpleasant atmosphere. The weather was amazing at the time, however there were multiple fans at unnecessarily high speeds blowing mist everywhere which would have been great if it was significantly hotter outside. Also, there were small orange bugs that kept biting us and got all over and inside our drinks which we assumed was because of the amount of moisture in the air from the misting fans. Obviously, there isn't much you can do about bugs on an outside dining area, but I feel as if there are precautionary measures that could be taken to avoid bugs getting into our drinks and presumably also our food. \n\nThe only positive aspect of this restaurant was the spectacular view. We went at sunset and it looked unbelievable from our vantage point. If I ever go there again, I will not spend a dime, go upstairs to the bar area, and enjoy the view.", "date": "2014-06-02 21:52:34"}

I was upset because we weren't going to eat until 10:15 at that point but I understood that it was crowded and we had to wait. What bothered me the most was while waiting for at this point over an hour, there were a TON, I mean a TON of empty tables. All different size tables too. Seeing some of the servers kinda standing around, I went up to the host stand and spoke to who seem to be one of the mangers. He was rude and gave me attitude about the empty tables. He said with an attitude \"I'm trying to seat 700 people\". I said \"I get that, which is why I'm asking why it's taking so long to turn tables over when you have all these empty tables\". I understand it was a busy night, however standing around for an hour and half while there were so many empty tables was very annoying. Ultimately we left after waiting an two hours because it was 10:00 at that point and I was starving. Later I heard from others that the food was overpriced and not that good.

Sure, the food would punch you in the stomach and pillage your wallet, but the view made up for it. Of course, you had to park a mile away on an unpaved lot. Lake Travis actually had water in it. Those were the days, man.\n\nThen along came a lightning bolt. Things got a little caliente at The Oasis, and I'm not talking about the salsa. \n\nThe Oasis rose from the ashes, but this was not a phoenix story. A monstrosity grew. And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\n\nThis beast was big. Oasis is bloated. It is no longer just a restaurant with some decks. It is a monument to 'Murica where if some is good, then a ton is badass. The parking situation is improved, and the view is almost as good as it was. Water levels are way down, but a little marketing could fix the problem. \"Come see Lake Travis, the land of a thousand sand bars!\"\n\nOasis is a place that Yelpers and locals love to hate. I'm all for getting out the ole pitchforks and torches, but let's not overstate the case. The Oasis development is gaudy and transparently designed to get tourists giddy on terrible $10 sourmix-a-ritas, then lighten their wallets. The much reviled food is not that bad. It's garden variety Tex Mex.\n\nThe problem is the price. Beef fajitas for 1 for $18.95? Are you kidding? Do you know what $19 can buy at a place like Jack Allen's Kitchen or Salty Sow? If you slashed the menu prices by 40% across the board, then the value might be reasonable. But then, how would they pay the rent and taxes on this monstrosity? Now it becomes clear.\n\nLike it or not, The Oasis is an Austin institution, and it is a place that can be enjoyed with the right expectations. You don't have to be gouged by the $14 enchiladas. The view and chips and salsa are free.

In the summer, you must arrive by 6:15pm (no wait) at the latest; plan on relaxing at your table until the sun goes down.  If you arrive around 7pm, you are going to wait in 1 line to get on the list for a table (around 30 minutes), then the list-line will be a 1-1.5 hour wait (depending on how far off sunset is).  The wait time difference is SIGNIFICANT depending on when you arrive.\n2)  Bring good friends/family - this place is a GREAT place to sit back and relax and catch up with friends.  Don't bring impatient people who don't like to linger over a meal.\n3)  Don't drink the on-the-rocks margaritas.  Even the bartenders suggest the frozen; befriend the bartender in the lower-level bar, it's worthwhile.\n4)  Don't valet, park and do the shuttle if you don't want to walk.\n5)  Order generic food.  Read the reviews.  I, personally, have never had a bad fajita here, but I would suggest steering clear of the \"mexican\" food.  The oasis is not known for their food.  Remember, you are going there for the VIEW and the ATMOSPHERE.\n\nPlease remember, this is a fantastic place to people watch, statue watch (weird), look at the view, chill with your friends and family, shop for lovely jewelry (oh wait, got caught up in the oasis moment).  It will seem like Sea World when you approach, but remember -- there are cocktails inside, don't be intimidated.  And most importantly.  TIMING TIMING TIMING.  If you don't want to wait, get there during the \"Luby's hour\" (as I call the 6 oclock dining hour).  I, personally, am an operational manager - I'd love to take the management over just to help streamline the people herding, but if you can set that aside (easy to do), then you won't mind the strange inconveniences of lines to get into line (it feels like you are living a fractal pattern).\n\nPS.  Oasis staff - way to go!  I had fantastic service this last trip - probably talked to 8 different staff members and every one was fantasticly helpful!  Much improved from previous years!", "date": "2010-07-28 03:33:50"}

Because there is a car show and even though there is a 3 story parking structure, it was full because all the car from the show took it over, since they are vintage, some cars took two spots. We got lucky, after 35 mins, we got valet parking. BUT other guest in our party wasn't so lucky, they waited for 30 mins to the valet and they said VALET IS FULL. \n\nSo the question how come we didn't know there is a car show? Because the website didn't no mention of it. \n\nWhy in the world they have a car show that took over all the parking space on a busy Saturday evening when, I don't know, people are here to have dinner? I don't know the logic behind it. Must be the thinking, hey, you waited for 35 mins to park and since you are here for a party, you can't leave, so you are stuck here anyways. \n\nAnd they are right, I'm here for the party, I can't leave even though I was pissed. My friend who was hosting the party kept apologizing to us for the mess Oasis caused and of course we don't blame her, who knew Oasis would have more than half of their parking taken over by the car show on a Saturday night??? Only if there is a platform that informs everyone, someone should invent that platform and call it Webnet, no, Interweb, no, Internet. Yeah, use Internet to announce events like that. That's freaking brilliant. \n\nThe only \"positive\" thing out of it is that we see some ladies walking up hills in their heels because the wait was so long. They have really toned legs, it was a great view.

This one tasted way too thin, like everything was blended together. No texture at all. I got the pulled pork enchiladas and they were not very good.

I sorta want to give it three but I just can't justify it. The chips and salsa were so-so, the food was overpriced, the drinks were weak, and the service was pretty bad. It's too bad really since it has a *great* location, overlooking the lake from high above. But it is what it is and, after scanning some other Yelp reviews after the fact, it seems I'm not alone.\n\nI went with a decent sized group after work - about 14 people total. We'd actually intended to to the place next door - an \"uncle\" BBQ place (out of respect, I'll leave the name out of this review) - but they were closed on a Tuesday with new \"winter\" hours. *snaps fingers* Dern it. Ah well, the whole area is beautiful and clearly intended to dazzle. In fact, I took pictures of the courtyard area just outside The Oasis as it was just beautiful and lush, filled with interested areas.\n\nAnd then we went in, walking past a grand staircase and a really cute bar area with wicker chairs that just beckoned for you to sit, relax, sip margaritas and talk with friends. The place wasn't that busy so we got a nice table outside, with views overlooking the lake. Gorgeous!\n\nAnd so that's all the good stuff.\n\nI'll skip to the particulars of what I didn't like about The Oasis as, no matter how well you tell a bad story, it's still a bad story. Ours started with an extremely long/delayed drink ordering process. We were assigned one waiter, but he had helpers, and yet it was a good 30 minutes from when we sat down until they started asking for orders. It was at this 30 minute mark that we also got the chips and salsa. The chips were wonderful but the salsa just so-so. It wasn't spicy nor that flavorful and so the baskets went largely untouched beyond bored nibbles. This is a \"gourmet\" Mexican restaurant (my word, not theirs) which specializes in pricey tex-mex and a few token sandwich choices. It was another 30-40 minutes until the food came out. I had the Tilapia del Mar - blackened tilapia with shrimp and scallions in a lobster sauce. It was ok, but small. I finished my $18 meal quickly and began nibbling the chips some more, waiting for the waiter (again) to ask for a refill. You know it's bad when the talk around the table switches from the beautiful view to lack of flavor in the meal, and then worse - \"has anyone seen the waiter in awhile.\" And so it went.\n\nNow I don't normally look at my watch too much while dining out. But I will mention this last part because it will emphasis the slowness of the service. At around 7:20 my friend asked me for the time. We were sharing a car on this trip and we were trying to get to Best Buy before they closed at 9pm - \"Ah, it's 7:20. Plenty of time.\" Or so I thought. We were done eating, you see. We were waiting for the waiter to return so we could ask for the check. It took someone going inside about 15 minutes later to get him to come out. He informed us that policy was to not split the tab - so we all dug out cash or cards and divy'd things up. It wasn't bad and it only took us 5 minutes or so. Oddly, we all watched, somewhat entertained and yet also mystified, as the waiter took it all inside and stood in front of the cash register computer for a good 7 or 8 minutes. \"What could be taking him so long - enter the cash total, and ring up the amounts on the 6 credit cards.\" That was, after all, exactly what he'd recommend we do. \"Happens all the time\" he said. And so around 8:15 we finally got our cards back and began exiting the restaurant. In case you were curious, we *did* make it to Best Buy with 4 minutes to spare. Go us!", "date": "2012-10-28 02:59:59"}

First off, getting to the Oasis was a pain. Since the restaurant is situated on a cliff there were so many ups and downs and tight curves to get there, and many of the cars on the opposite side were coming over the line driving crazy around there. Once we got to the restaurant I thought the atmosphere was great, it was perfect weather and the environment was lively (full of people). On this particular night there were about 3 separate events so we waited about 1hr and 10 minutes for a table. In the mean time we had margaritas, walked around and watched the sunset on the lake. \nOnce seated, we didn't have the best waiter, he only paid attention to one particular table that ordered a lot of drinks and the rest of his tables he'd stop by maybe 2 times depending on what you asked for. I had beef enchiladas, rice and beans and my girlfriend had the combo chicken and beef fajitas. You also get an Oasis souvenir cup! The food was ok, I've had better Tex-Mex food in San Antonio but I think you just come to The Oasis for the atmosphere and view of Lake Travis. Enjoy!", "date": "2017-10-18 02:57:09"}

I want to love you.  Your views are amazing of the sunsets.  Your beers are cold.  Your fans work great and the misters help beat the heat.  The deck set up is amazing.  But your food. It still...it still...itstillprettymuchsucks.  My girlfriend took me here for Father's Day because we were in the area out by the lake, the sun was going down, and we were starving.  We went here, and I will say the chips, salsa, and guacamole were pretty good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Then everything after that was not great.\n\nI had the Mexican steak and it was cooked well but the sauce was too sweet.  It was a decent cut of meat which I found surprising, but I didn't like the flavor that much.  The sides were plain and bland.  My girlfriend barely ate any of her shrimp and she LOVES shrimp.  They were sadly very over-cooked and tough.  Nor did she want to box up anything and neither did I.  I almost ALWAYS finish my plate, I HATE wasting food, and I left about 1/3 of it uneaten.\n\nThe service here was really good, our waitress was awesome and I would give them 2.5 starts mainly because our server was great: she was hustling, smiling, and got everything right.  But if I have to go up to 3 or down to 2 stars I'm definitely going down on this one.  We saw her politely bear the rude comments of some guests with aplomb.  I wanted to go over there and pour my beer on their heads.  \n\nThe food runner that brought me my steak didn't bring a steak knife, and when my girlfriend asked another waiter for a steak knife he said, \"I think we're out.\"  She said, \"Try doing better than that.  Bring me a knife please.\"  Our waitress finally brought me one and apologized, (not her fault), but I got to sit there and look at my steak getting cold for a while rather than eat it like a cave man.  \n\nAs we were leaving the tubs that the staff that bus the tables use were stacked like three high outside the doors of what I assume was the upstairs dishwashing area and they were all over the floor.  It was kinda gross.  I know they were busy but wow.\n\nI am going to try the Oasis Brewing restaurant and bar next time, then maybe go to the Oasis at sunset for a beer.  One beer.

I was wedged between the cinder block the umbrella shaft was set in and my peers to either side.\nVegetable fajitas looked like shit.

I think they're too busy with too limited a staff. Should have some dedicated waterboys running around.\n\nFor this they imposed the grat. That's impressive.

The food was always mediocre, but the atmosphere was relaxed and all the quirky wood decks gave great views of sunset over Lake Travis.\n\nSometime between the time I moved away and my most recent visit this place sold its soul. The quirky wood decks fell victim to a fire but rather than rebuild better than ever they created a monument to commercialism and greed that wouldn't feel out of place in Vegas or Disneyland where the obvious goal is to extract as much money from you as quickly as possible while providing the worst service they can get away with. Park in the sea of cars and pay a fee for a golf cart to drive you to the restaurant (or pay a fee for valet that doesn't go to the valet staff, but rather to the company). Then stand in a plastic-rope-managed line to check in at the host stand, where if you are lucky they will tell you that there is an hour wait and not more. While you wait, you can hit the bar where there is no table staff, no snacks, and no view of the lake. But there is another rope-controlled line to stand in in order to get drinks at the bar. Or you can peruse the Oasis-branded stuff at the large gift shop, or look at materials for the Oasis-branded wedding packages, or visit the Oasis-branded brewery. Don't try to talk to the staff, they are frantically rushing around, stressed to the max (this place boasts about being able to seat 2000 people), and thus they are generally rude and dismissive. The answer is always \"no\" anyways. No, you can't wait at those strangely-empty-even-though-there-is-a-wait tables. No, you can't stand there to watch the sunset. No, you can't get chips and salsa in the bar. No, you can't open a tab.  No, you can't split the check. (And no, they don't take reservations). \n\nAnd the food is still mediocre at best. They even have a Sysco logo on their menu like they're proud of it! (Seriously, check their web site!) Who needs quality when the tourists won't come back anyways.", "date": "2018-11-07 18:44:50"}

One would think that as Huuuuge as The Oasis is, they would expand on their menu. It just seems very limited in my opinion. Last time I was there, I made the joke that I had more menu choices at McDonalds, and a girl at a table next to me leaned over and agreed. And yes, some as well as I may say their prices are a bit steep for such common food, but I know realistically, I'm not paying for the food, I'm paying for the value of real estate my seat is taking up on the hill. But as a wise voice once said from a cornfield, \"If You Build It, They Will Come.\"  And sure enough they are. Now I can't comment on the drinks here, but I had some friends go on a couple of occasions, during slow & busy times, and said that drinks were either watered down, or were lacking of an alcohol spirit. So ya, there ya have it.", "date": "2008-04-25 03:56:18"}

After being told it would be a 30 minute wait and being directed to an inadequate bar with only 2 overwhelmed bartenders, the wait stretched to about an hour.  So after missing the sunset and the temperature dropping into the 40's, we were shown to a table on a newly opened lower deck where there was only one set of customers.  AND they were leaving because it was too cold.  When I asked where the heaters were, the seater told me those were on the upper levels.  I told her this was unacceptable and we would just take a seat inside.  She told me I would have to go back to the front desk and get back on the waiting list.  We picked up and left at that point, went down RR 620 to the Hill Country Pasta House and had a great experience.  I went to the Oasis website and entered a complaint the next day about the experience, adding that as a former restaurant manager, I felt management should be aware of what happened.

Everyone knew the food wasn't the greatest, but the view and decent drinks made it worth it.\n\nWhen the place burned down in 2007ish, it was a big deal and upsetting for Austin. I remember going for drinks a couple times after it burnt down to show support even though it was essentially just a porch overlooking the remnants of the old Oasis and of course, beautiful Lake Travis.\n\nFast forward to today - I don't even know where to begin. The new Oasis \"compound\" is so absurdly large that it could be seen from a plane; I'm sure it could probably qualify for it's own zipcode. There are multiple restaurants, a parking garage, office space, event space, and what appears to be a hotel or some sort of lodging - all in the existing Oasis space. \n\nYou enter the Oasis to be greeted by a set of tween girls with bluetooth-like ear pieces on and about 10 LCD screens - just to handle seating. After about a 8 minute walk through the dozens of bars, decks, stairs, floors and general gaudiness, you eventually get to your seat. Service is essentially non-existant. (Personally, if I worked there, I'd probably get lost ... just saying.) \n\nMy wife and I only stayed for one margarita. She described her house  margarita as: \"it's like after you've finished a good margarita and there's that lime-ish, slightly salty ice water left in the glass.\"\n\nI will not be back. You'll find me at Mansfield Dam park flasking tequila and watching the view of the lake from there. (I'm kidding ... well, maybe...)", "date": "2011-05-24 18:44:58"}

The server warned us that the fajitas would be very fast- and offered to put the Queso in first- so he already let us know the order might be off.  We had combo fajitas and the chicken was well seasoned and the sides were fresh with warm flour tortillas.  The beef was a bit chewy and tough.

After a fire a few years ago, the owners rebuilt something scary in its place.  \n\nThe old Oasis was a fun, oddball place a good ways from town - it was a destination, with great views and a tradition where everyone clapped at sunset.  I was a teenager the first time I went, and back then when there was almost nothing between Austin and this place.  The lake was high, roads out here were rural and it was just a ramshackle, fun spot to go to.  \n\nSo, time passes, I went off to college, got married, and started bringing my own family here - by this point (late 90s) it had swankified a little bit, but the food quality was suffering.  It was a spot people went to specifically for the view..  They didn't put a lot of effort into the food because there was still going to be a market for the Oasis even if it it was average, and that's just... lazy.   A few more years pass, and though you don't go expecting a great dining experience, it's still a fun place to bring out-of-town friends... plus there was an art gallery/antique shop housed in a Victorian house next door, and a new music venue, though I was never there when a band was playing.  I'm not even sure the parking lot was completely paved.\n\nI went last week for the first time in probably 8 years, and didn't recognize it.  The hostess explained it was a totally new building, placed on the site of the original which burned down some years ago.  I had completely forgotten.  The decks are the same, so that's neat, but it's not just a restaurant anymore.  It's a sprawling complex with various shops, constructed like a little Disney faux village, but with an odd western-themed interpretation.  It's what an overpriced architect who had never actually been here would imagine Austin was like.  The whole situation is so, so weird and even a little creepy... and the statues all over the front entranceway give me the heebie jeebies. \n\nThe food is still mediocre at best, the lake is tragically low, and now, rather than beautiful Texas countryside, you get to look at bloated mini-mansions crowding the hills before you go pick up your SUV in the parking structure.

In that we arrived before sunset we managed to take some good photos. Overall food, pricing and service were acceptable considering this cliffside establishment is primarily a tourist attraction. We chose the Fajitas and weren't disappointed. Our server Grayson was very attentive throughout.", "date": "2018-10-29 12:01:55"}

They have a good amount of parking and even have a shuttle to the place. When you get closer, you can see that this place is huge. I didn't even get to the brewery side. The wait is long so plan ahead. You can not call ahead, it's first come first serve, so just know you will be hanging out before being seated (they have a bar, gift shop-very cute, must go in and check out all the stuff, and brewery so this is ok) however, no food is served at the bar. Wish they had at least some munches like chips and salsa or something while you have a drink. But anyways, so when you walk up, they have staff everywhere so you can ask questions and they reach out to help guide you. You get in line to make a reservation which they take on iPads and then wait until you get a text telling you to go to the hostess desk to be seated. We were seated outside and it was hot for awhile, but it is nice that they do everything they can to block the sun for you. We sat down and ordered drinks. The Oasis Daydreamer was amazing. Would reorder in a heartbeat. And you get to keep the glass. Our waiter (Blake) was amazing and even brought us clean glasses at the end so we could take them home and not have them sticky from our drinks. When we ordered, Blake was more than helpful as we tried to find out what we wanted to eat. He told us everything that was amazing and it sure lead us into making the right decision. Some have said that the food is not that great. This made me skeptical about staying for dinner, but I think it's really you just need to know what is good to order and what is just sub-par. My friend got the bbq brisket sandwich and I had the shrimp tacos. Both were good and I would order them again. The shrimp was cooked perfect and had good flavor. As for the view, it was amazing. It lived up to the talk. After the sun goes down, the weather is perfect. You could see the owners house from where we were sitting. Our waiter also was very awesome at informing us about the area (about the owner) which was nice to hear about since we knew nothing about the place. Will definitely be returning and would ask for Blake if we have the option.", "date": "2016-05-30 06:18:46"}

Arrived @4, wait time was 45 min to an hour for outside. No problem, we walked around to the shops and killed some time. It was starting to get a little cold, so we decided to change to inside. We got seated right away on the second floor by the window. There were plenty of tables open outside, and the inside was mostly empty. We waited about 10 minutes for a server, and ordered everything. Drinks came, good margaritas, food took another 40 minutes, and this is where the regrets really begin. The seafood enchilada with crawfish cream sauce was more like a cream cheese and spinach dip wrapped in a tortilla with shrimp and sauce on top. Sadly, the cream cheese was clumpy and slightly congealed because it used to be hot (maybe) but it wasn't anymore.   Also, no evidence of any seafood in the enchilada, just some sad shrimp hitching a ride on top. What I really want to know, do they use Philadelphia cream cheese, or is it the H-E-B brand?  The combo fajita was a complete dud, it came out on a semi hot fajita skillet, and there was no sizzle, just meat and veggies on a skillet,  might as well have been on a paper plate. And finally the fish tacos. Uninspired, and only memorable because the fish was also semi hot and for some reason it was loaded with  chopped hot peppers. I don't like to complain about food, but we mentioned the issue to the server and he didn't have much of a response. We ate around what we could, paid and left. When we left, the second floor inside and outside were nearly empty, and there were still people being told 30-45 min for seating. This place should get out of the food business and sell sunsets, that is the only appealing thing about this restaurant and they couldn't possibly mess that up.  Maybe?

We visited The Oasis while in Austin honeymooning at Lakeway Resort And Spa.\n\nThe Oasis is a tex-mex restaurant. And no, the food isn't amazing, 5-star stuff and that's the biggest complaint people have. But when you compare one place to another place you have to compare apples to apples. People are giving this place a bad review because they're rating only the food and comparing it to other more upscale restaurants where you just go sit in a dining room. \n\nBut you don't go here simply for the food. This restaurant isn't about just enjoying a meal. It's about enjoying a meal while watching an amazing sunset over Lake Travis. Practically the whole thing is chiseled out of the side of a cliff, over 400 feet high over the lake. Watching the sun drop behind those hills at the other side of the lake from a table on the side of a cliff is why people line up and wait 45 minutes EVERY night of the week to eat here. We were here on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. \n\nAs far as the food goes, honestly I'd say the food was on par with maybe an El Phoenix or something similar. It's not amazing but it's certainly not bad. We enjoyed what we had. But again, if you rate it only on the food you're simply missing the point of coming here. \n\nAnother big complaint I see in reviews is the price. Our bill for two was just under $40 not counting 2 margaritas we had while we waited. Those ran another $17. That brings our tab to a poverty-inducing $57, guys. Not what I'd call terribly expensive for the whole experience. For the food only? Absolutely. \n\nBut let's be honest. You're being naive if you expect this place not to charge a little more for the experience of having dinner jutting out of the side of a cliff, 400 feet above Lake Travis while counting down the last seconds of a beautiful sunset. With cheers and bells ringing and picture-taking at that. This place absolutely celebrates the setting of the sun every single day.\n\nI really want everyone reading this to \"get\" that, because I think this place isn't getting reviewed for what it is. I don't think they'll let me post a link here but if you search for my name (Ron Cross) along with \"the oasis lake travis\" you can probably pull up a youtube video I shot while my wife and I were there. You'll get it then.\n\nListen, go somewhere else for mind-blowing tex-mex while you look at ugly pictures on yellow walls and listen to really annoying music. Come here to sit at a table on the side of a cliff overlooking Lake Travis with a bunch of other people, watch an amazing sunset and cheer at the end.....and oh yeah, have some food while you do it. \n \nYou do need to get there about an hour early though to get a good spot for the sunset because they don't take reservations.The exact time the sun will set is posted on their website every day.", "date": "2016-07-23 18:30:19"}

I've read several articles about Mr. Theriot and he seems like a savvy businessman. Why does the food and service not improve?\n\nAfter a 1.5 hour wait, our party of 6 was seated at 2 round table pushed together. Really? Who wants to sit in the middle of two round tables?? Our margaritas were awful and served in plastic cups. Tacky. Our food was awful. The fajitas were tough and old, my daughter's burger was extremely undercooked. It was bloody  and cold in the middle. I like my steaks medium rare so pink doesn't bother me but she bit into a cold, raw burger and spit it out.  My other daughter's salad was watery. Every single item they brought us was just bad. \n\nThe single reason we bother dining at The Oasis is because out of towners want to experience the view. We've obliged them up until now. Never again. \n\nI get that Mr. Theriot really doesn't *need* to care about the quality of the food served nor does it matter that the customer service is so bad. People will keep coming no matter what. Not me. Not ever again.\n\nAnother thing that might be slightly petty but peeved me. We were offered a ride on a cart from our parking spot to the front door. Great! I sat in the front with the driver and my husband sat in the very back. We were the only people on the cart. The driver approached my whole family so he knew we were one group. I got off the cart first and I tipped the guy $10.  As we approached the host stand my husband told me \"I tipped the guy $10\". What? And he took it? He absolutely knew we were together. So I know that's our fault for not communicating to one another but the driver should have declined the tip from my husband. He should have said \"No sir, your wife already tipped me\" and my husband might have given it to him anyway. Creep.", "date": "2016-04-10 13:12:08"}

That is if you are lucky enough to be along an edge. Otherwise, they cram a ton of seats, tables, and umbrellas in a small space, turn a bunch of fans on to circulate the hot Texan air. That is the positive. The negative: Everything else! We order our food, fajitas with cut avocado (No raw onions on the dishes). They come out with Pico (raw onion, tomatoes, and cilantro) on the queso (melted cheese). I peel it off and move on. My meal comes out... Raw onion in my black beans, Pico with the lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. I send the bowl back, so all I am left with is my chicken and peppers. I tell the server that there weren't suppose to be onions on anything, he leaves. Our waitress comes to check on us - I'm not eating. I tell her the issue and she tells me she will check on it. She comes back, empty handed and tells me that they cook the rice in the morning with onions. I tell her that's fine, I can eat cooked onions, not raw onions. She asked why, so I notified her that in allergic to them (my throat closes up)! Waitress tells me that I should announce it when ordering. Actually if I don't want something and order it without, I should get it how I order it! She leaves and delivery boy comes back; raw onions in my black beans, guacamole with onions, no rice, no sliced avocado. I send the beans back, and figure I will just move the guacamole out of the way. Waitress comes back, I tell her the issue, she says she'll look into it and walks away. My fajitas and peppers are now cold, the tortillas are hard and cold like cardboard. I am trying to eat it while the deliverry boy comes back with an overflowing cup of black beans (on raw onions on top) and nothing else. He leaves and I stir the beans, the raw onions are in it, they just poured more on top to hide them. Glad I didn't eat them, there food is NOT worth going to the hospital for! Never got my sliced avocado, never got any rice, NEVER saw the manager. And my check? They gave me a discount of not having to pay for the black beans or cheese, guacamole, or lettuce... Oh how nice of them! I would NEVER RETURN! The manager should be fired for not training the employees well and for not coming to talk to a customer when the food was wrong, not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES and all the requested food didn't come out! What a waste of time and money! But hey, the view was nice!", "date": "2018-05-27 20:59:49"}

I think the Oasis truly captures the beauty of its surroundings, like the hills and valleys around it. I'm a sucker for stuff like this...which you don't encounter every day...just saying! Although my coworker and I rushed to get here (we were about 30 miles away from work) for lunch, I felt relaxed and at peace. \n\nOkay sorry for the tangent but I also have to say that the service was really accommodating. We had to eat FAST so the waitress made sure to get the food out ASAP and hand us our check right then and there. I had 10 minutes to eat!!! Although I couldn't take my time to enjoy the shrimp tacos, I remember liking them! The shrimp was well cooked and everything else was good too. FYI free chips and salsa...but pretty spicy salsa. \n\nFood is 3.5 stars, dining experience 4!\n\nTbh if I were in Austin again, I would come here again. No shame!", "date": "2013-07-30 05:17:04"}

No it was not a gourmet steak house but that is not that they are portraying themselves to be. It was comparable to Chilis, probably even a little better, but none the less it was no where near what we were expecting based on what we were hearing. They had two live bands. We only heard one, which was very good. Tons of people of all ages where dancing and having a great time. \n\nSo basically the views/atmosphere were amazing, the food was good, and the live music was a blast.

I took my family who drove 16 hours to see me to Oasis, and I was totally embarrassed by the service, food and the god damn hostess attitude. We asked when arrive for a seat with a view, she told us they have some. She took us to this corner table shoved in the by the edge and said that's it. It was big enough for 2 person and maybe a kid. We had four adults. We asked if we can look elsewhere and she started giving attitude. All other hostess with 4 people already grabbed what's available, so we asked if we can sit at the 6 person table. She told we can't, and we are not allow to go downstairs where there are 50 tables empty. As soon we we sat down at this table with no view, all other hostess started walking people down for the tables with view. Whatever, she has no sense so be it. Then we got our waitress who was clearly high on drugs. When asking her stuff she will response 3 seconds late. We asked for drink refills, never came. Chips refill, nothing. Even checks we waited and waited(no, she wasn't busy). She will look at us and walk by us many times with the stuff we need and still can't remember that we asked. The chicken sandwich was cold. The burger was tasteless. I left totally embarrassed with the type of service. They had a sign stating \"interview onsite, hire immediately...\"the type of people they hire and the food don't justify the view. And certainly not worth a $60 lunch bill with a high on drug no service waitress. Seriously, you can go to the side of the restaurant and snap a picture for free. then just run.

Only ate the shrimp they were regular size. The sides was rice and grilled veggies which tasted awful I didn't even eat it. I was expecting a delicious and good looking plate since it was more than $25. Finally when check came my plate alone was over $30 due to taxes and 18% gratuity ($5).

About 6:20 we were finally able to flag down a waiter to request some water.   He brought chips 10 minutes later and said he would be right back with salsa.  We did not get any salsa until we asked him two more times and that was brought to the table at about 7:20.  That level of service was pretty much what we got the rest of the night.  We ordered food at 6:45 and the food did not arrive at our table until 8:20 -  after getting up, searching down the waiter and asking him several times what the problem seemed to be!  The waiter kept telling us they were just really busy.  This was a Saturday evening and I would suspect, no more busy than typical.  Even worse  - two of the hamburgers ordered were stone cold.    The waiter never stopped at the table to ask if we needed anything.  The manager did come to the table at one point to say the food would be ready momentarily (we'd asked to cancel our order) but it was still another 30 minutes.

Apparently, the menu they gave me is 5 years old and not accurate for allergies.  Um...that's helpful...print yourself a new menu if you are aware your current one has inaccurate information on it.  \n\nThe server eventually brought back a printout dated 2013 and flashed it in front of me.

After pulling into their sprawling parking lot (you can get a lift via golf cart if you find the distance from car to restaurant to be too daunting), I was quite surprised to find a massive, crowded multi-story complex. We got a table on one of the uppermost levels which had a fairly nice, unobstructed view, but all through our meal we were subject to random yahoos wandering about our table from farther back to get a better look at the lake - this sort of thing might have been tolerable if not for frequent visits from a bunch of unsupervised unruly kids who seemed to have mistaken The Oasis for Chuck E Cheese.  Service was friendly but very spotty & awkward - our server was nice as could be, but he was often missing for extended periods.  And it seemed that no one on staff was terribly interested in dealing with the kids running amuck around us.\n\nFood-wise, we had a bunch of appetizers - OK if you are a fan of cheese, but otherwise nothing special.  The drinks were not bad.\n\nAs far as the sunset view goes - yeah, that's the reason we came out, but we left about 10 minutes before sunset as everyone was suddeny feeling very chilly as the sun started its descent.

Even the margaritas are terribly average and the wine selection is poor.  I think they will continue to pack 'em in because of the iconic image of the place, but like many here have said... don't go for the food.", "date": "2011-07-22 21:44:56"}

The views were quite spectacular, and it was great to sit out on the patio in perfect 80-degree weather in the evening.  The food, as expected, was mediocre, probably on par with a Chevy's.  We started off with chips, salsa, guac, and \"queso\", all of which were ok.  I got to try fried avocado, which is a local tex-mex specialty...I gotta say it was worth trying at least once, but not sure it's something I would get again.  Avocado just tastes so great on its own, don't think the breaded coating and the frying really helped.  The mini-tacos I ordered for my entree were actually pretty good, but at that point I was pretty full from all the chips.  The margaritas were just ok though, I thought the one I had from Fonda San Miguel the previous day was a lot better.\n\nDon't go here for the food, but this is a great place to enjoy the sunset and warm weather.", "date": "2012-05-28 00:08:03"}

Having been to many \"coastal\" and dined at restaurants with wonderful scenic views, this place was a total rip off and a poor job indeed. I only came here because my friend's bachelorette party dinner was here, and I already had a bad feeling based on many of the other yelper's experiences. \n\nThis is going to be a long rant on the poor service received at this location.. I'm sorry but dining here is totally not worth it. \n\nWe went on a Saturday night, around 7pm and got seated in about 15 minutes or so. The server quickly moved us around to another part of the restaurant (for some unknown reason) and sat us down there, though the the move was probably made so we can accommodate her section. I don't know if she was having a bad day or not, but she took her frustration out on the whole group as she didn't hide her attitude or \"I don't care about #$%^\" tone of voice throughout the whole time. \n\nThe food was alright. I wouldn't pay that much for something that tasted like dry meat made with the cheapest material in the world.\n\nSo here it goes. Maybe I'm just used to better service, but I wanted to take the tray out of my server's hand and beat her with it. SARA (Yes, I remember your name - at least that's what it says on my receipt) was my blonde and terrible server. With eight girls who are just trying to eat (we weren't even high maintenance and we ordered moderately priced meals, no alcohol because we were going to go somewhere else later), she was sure rude. I don't understand why servers have this feeling of entitlement (also, I know we are paying for the experience overlooking the lake, hence the overpriced food), but you don't have to outright display your animosity towards us during the whole meal. Our drinks were not refilled once, and while she made multiple efforts going back and forth, refilling drinks for patrons who ta-da, spent money on ALCOHOL (your bill is higher) she made no eye contact whatsoever. She brought out the check and while we were trying to split it, made an impatient grunt. REALLY?!? Go back a few months/years ago where YOU applied for this job, YOU got this job, and this is YOUR JOB! Suck it up and WORK. This is why some establishments, while location and advertising do a great job (food wise, no comment), service just drives potential patrons away. Our check was $45 dollars (including gratuity) split amongst three girls (After separated since we shared the fajita for 2) and that included the gratuity already. While I was trying to explain how we wanted it split, she left halfway before I finished speaking without even acknowledging me. We gave 15 dollars in cash and asked to split the rest of the bill in half (Makes 15 dollars each of the other two). My check came back and I saw $15.12 + included gratuity of $2.51. Sure, WHAT!? I don't know how 45-15 = 30 / 2 = 15 would also ADD another tip of $2.51 from my credit card and the other girl who used her card. As my experience before as a server, I was terribly suspicious but the girls were in a hurry and I couldn't complain. I scribbled $15.12 as the total on the card but surprise, surprise, my bank statement today shows $17.63 being charged. I know it's not such big money (as I do spend MUCH MORE at other places) it just makes me irked that the people here would blatantly rip off customers little money at a time, and that is just wrong.  \n\nDON'T GO! Scenic view is totally not worth the service and food here.", "date": "2010-11-09 15:23:36"}

My wife wanted a salad which she couldn't have because of the romaine lettuce recall, dont know why the didn't substitute with different lettuce , oh well.

If I rated the restaurant alone, it wouldn't be more than 2-3 stars, because you go to the oasis for the\nScenery and definitely not the overpriced food and service.\n\nAnyway. Back to the wedding. The reception was held on the third floor of the oasis and was amazing. The staff was beyond attentive, and I appreciated that they knew what meals each guest was going to have ahead of time, so that they weren't \"auctioning off\" meals. The kids also received their meals about two minutes after they say down, which was a nice touch. The bartenders were beyond personable and friendly; big props to them. The meal I had (blackened salmon with a seafood risotto and saut\u00e9ed broccolini) was the best meal I've had at the oasis, by a long shot.\n\nOf course, the highlight of the night was being able to enjoy the lake with a cocktail, along with good friends. However there were 3 downsides of this venue, but none were big enough to reduce it below 4 stars:\n\n1) The reception area was not blocked off\nat first and we had some crashers, who wanted to take pictures. Interesting, odd, and creepy all at once.\n\n2) the outside is very loud, with bad karaoke sounding bands on a Saturday, but this is the oasis, and it was expected that it would be loud.\n\n3) there were some plates missing from the electrical outlets. Yes, this is picky, but it was also a bit of a safety hazard for my\nfriends with children.\n\nOverall, best wedding venue I've been to, thus far.", "date": "2012-03-28 22:36:14"}

Our server on 1/17/15 was Tyrone and he gave us good service. The specialty margarita I had was called the Gold Margarita and was quite yummy so I had two. They were that good. Now, onto the food... I had the fish tacos. They were tilapia fish on corn tortilla with a yummy sauce and pico de gallo. There was a smear of guacamole on the side. Should have been more than a little smear on a bed of lettuce. I know that avocados are expensive but at least give a tablespoon of guacamole! The best part of my meal is that the fish was blackened and still moist but completely cooked through and not fishy. The rice and beans on the side were very tasty as well. My wife had the surf and turf fajitas which were decent (according to her) as the shrimp were very good but the meat a tad tough. All in all a solid 4 stars.", "date": "2015-01-18 00:06:31"}

The food wasn't horrible (my table had shrimp tacos, fish tacos, beef fajitas, and chicken enchiladas), but it wasn't spectacular either.  The black beans left much to be desired, but I assumed that was possibly due to them being vegetarian prepared (read no pork or fat).  The rice was so so.

A dinner overlooking a lake with a beautiful sunset. This venue is huge to support lots of events, but their nightly event of serving up a spectacular sunset with dinner is definitely an attraction. The staff has making the view memorable down to a science. Sunset time is posted on their website daily and about 20 minutes before all umbrellas are removed so a clear view is available for all. \nSo a 5 for atmosphere!  \n\nThe food is a mix of Tex-Mex and American. Chips and salsa start the dining experience. The chips were light and crisp. I enjoyed the chicken pecan salad - large, tasty, and filling. My husband had the spicy chicken sandwich which he enjoyed. So a 4 for the food. \n\nThe service. Being so close to sunset, the servers get busy moving umbrellas and such so there are long periods of time when no one is available to provide water refills and such. Our waiter spilled some salsa on the table and I had to politely ask home if it could be cleaned up. So, I'd give the service a 3. \n\nWith an average of 4 stars I'd say the overall experience was a winner.

I don't know how you mess up a hamburger, but they sure enough did. When the waiter returned with a new burger (over 30 minutes to put in on the grill and cook it?)

I wish nothing short of a quick, painful demise of this horrid excuse for a Tourist Trap.  Hey...read any of my previous reviews, and I will go in to pleasurable depth describing all our visits.

(in fact, you can't give negative stars either)\n\nIn fairness, my venting here is directed in one, single, solitary direction:  the scrawny \"manager\" sportin' his industrial \"Dickies\" dockers half-way down his scrawny lil figure, with his block of a walkie-talkie helping to enhance his \"importance\" figure.  Enough venting - let's get to the FACTS:\n\nShowed-up yesterday with guests of ours who have travelled some 2000+ miles to experience true-Texas hospitality and flavor.  Although the Oasis isn't exactly true-Texas flavor, we \"thought\" we knew it as true-Texas hospitality.  Haha!  BAH to that.  The place was almost entirely deserted at the 3:30pm arrival time.  We did the self-tour with our guests who were awed by the views and smells of the food being served to the sparsely-crowded place.  Being that this is a \"tourist-trap\" with over-rated, under-valued, and over-priced food, I suggested we get some \"chips-n-salsa\" and just take in the views for a short while before heading out for a more suitable dinner.\n\nWe made our way back down to the front desk - and this is where we meet Mr. Scrawny-I-think-I'm-important-because-I-wear-a-walkie-talkie-and-my-tag-says-Manager.  Punk spoke to us in his \"hood\"-lingo, and spoke LOUD!  (did we look older than 40????).  No one in our party was doing sign-language and no one in our party was reading lips.  We heard your \"hood\"-lingo quite easily - so tone it down next time.\n\nWe explained that we wanted our (from VERY-far-away-out-of-town) guests to have a short, continued experience at the Oasis by grabbing a table for some Chips-n-Salsa.  Well, Mr. Scrawny went in to some \"hood\"-lingo-laced rant about how he had a \"7-hour\" wait, they were really, really busy, and couldn't allow us a table for just \"Chips-n-salsa and waters\".  SCREEEEEECH!  Wait just a cockin'-pickin' minute!  Who the @#$%#$%@ said anything about waters?  For all Mr. Scrawny knew, (which is actually true), our guests are quite the experienced wine drinkers and had fully planned on indulging in some local, Texas wines while munching down on some chips-n-salsa.  FURTHERMORE, had the chips-n-salsa been a BIG hit, the menu (and surrounding smells) could have encouraged scrapping our evening's dinner plans for the Oasis; our party of 6 \"could've\" made it a far more \"worthy\" opportunity for the Oasis.  \n\nBut no...Mr. Scrawny needed to repeat several times how he could not provide us with a table in his \"BUSY\", \"7-hour-wait\" joint for just \"chips-n-salsa-n-waters\", and that we could hang out in the lounge areas.\n\nWell, Mr. Scrawny...you and the rest of the folks there (whom I'm guessing are mostly college students hoping to earn a few bucks while struggling through school)...  This group of new-to-the-Texas-hospitality were appauled at your attitude and demeanor.  However, one thing is clear - they KNOW this isn't the norm for our area.  And, it is our pleasure to let you know, we hope your demise is forthcoming.\n\nHappy Holidays and Happy New Year to YOU!  :P\n\nBon Apetite - EVERYWHERE else but here!", "date": "2011-12-28 14:12:05"}

I can't even describe the taste, it was awful. I manage to choke down the rice, which had that horrible freezer burn taste, and the extremely bland black beans. WTF?! How could a restaurant serve food like this?! If I was the owner of the Oasis, I would be embarrassed by the crap that was coming out of my kitchen. \n\nSo I proceeded to get insanely drunk on their crappy margaritas and vodka sodas. I guess I can ultimately thank the Oasis for giving me inedible food, because it only took three drinks to throw me on the floor.\n\nIf you are dying to see the sunset on Lake Travis, skip the Oasis and head over to Uncle Billy's Brew & Que. Waaaay better food, and they have about 8 of their own beers on tap.", "date": "2011-01-05 17:13:02"}

The 6 of us eat and have drinks, watching a Beatles cover band.

She pulls up the GPS locator and sure enough, it's at the Oasis, though they've been closed for an hour.\n\nWhile she's upset, and headed out of town on business shortly, we figure no problem... we'll pick it up at open. Come the next morning, hours before the Oasis opens, it's no longer showing up on the GPS. She goes over at open, and is told that no iPhone was found. She explains that it was showing on the GPS (Find My iPhone) app an hour after they closed, and gets some comment about people being dishonest. We then wait a week for it to maybe show up before buying a new one.\n\nYou know who's dishonest... YOUR THIEVING EMPLOYEES!! \n\nThe next night, I start feeling sick...2 days later I'm in urgent care... the cause... food poisoning from Friday night. The doctor at the urgent care even called it... bad hamburger meat eaten late Friday.

We're there, trying to have fun, even without food, and we can't really walk around the table or anything because there is people already sweeping and standing in our way. Fine.

Hey, can you pass me the dirty plates???\" REALLY? \nIts not like we brought just a few people to spend money there. We brought 20 people. Everyone unsatisfied with the service, on a Friday night.

The response I've always gotten when I extend the invite: You'll be disappointed. And I was. \n\nI reference in almost every critique of a restaurant or bar that I've served and bartended before. As such, I'm pretty paticular about getting good service. Because I was damn good at my job and I know exactly what you should be doing when your'e serving me - I know when I should have water on my table, how often and in what incriments you should be coming back to check on me, how long my beverage should take based on the business of your section and the bartender, etc. I have high expectations because I did your job before, and I did it well... and it was a no-brainer. \n\nThat being said, I did like our server because I felt bad for him. He gave very poor service but was clearly inexperienced and honestly did his best to make up for it. He forgot to bring us our appetizer (queso) completely. From the top, our experience went like this: \n\nWe were seated on the third level balcony. The weather was nice. It took 15 minutes to even be greeted by a server and have our drink / appetizer order taken. In the meantime, the fans came on (though the weather didn't call for it) and made it impossible to have a conversation. Graciously, when we finally did get service, he turned them off. By the time we finished round one of drinks we were nearing 30 minutes of not being checked on for a second time and still not having our queso. On my way to take my daughter to the restroom, I brought this up to the waiter who made it clear he had just forgotten. He brought us our queso and another round of drinks immediately, which all hit the table at the same time as our meals. \n\nEveryone was satisfied with their meals but me. You may think now that it's because I'm over bearing and picky, but honestly, if something has cheese on it, I rarely complain. And it's hard to mess up Tex Mex in general. \n\nI ordered the Stuffed Avocado, pointing to it on the Appetizer portion of the menu when I ordered it. The waiter didn't specify that there is a Seafood Stuffed Avocado, as well. So he made that choice for me and I was brought the Seafood option - which I definitely didn't want. I could tell he was having a hard time, so I didn't complain. Until I bit into what was a chilled-cold avocado half that was covered with a lukewarm creamy sauce with chunks of raw shrimp and undercooked scallops. I almost lost my stomach at the table. I ate queso and my poblano chowder (Which was alright, until I pulled an entire bay leaf out of my mouth. For those who don't know, these are entirely inedible and must be removed from a dish before serving.) and made it through the meal quietly. \n\nThe atmosphere here is gorgeous. The service is absolutely unacceptable. And the food is incredibly sub-par. \n\nIt's worth going to the shops and the neighboring restaurants, but I'd never recommend this beyond the great pictures you can take or ordering adult beverages on the balcony.", "date": "2012-10-22 17:32:11"}

My rice and beans were cold despite the scalding temperature of the plate.

AGAIN.  Good gawd!  Could their food, AND DRINKS, be any worse?!?!?  I mean--who screws up Long-island iced tea, margaritas AND lemon-drop martinis? Oasis has the views--so, obviously, they know they can serve sub-standard food. The one-star is ONLY for the view.\n\nIt was Oct. 2015 and we hadn't been to Oasis since the lake filled up. We had out-of-towners in from California and decided that, on their first night in ATX, the sunset would be magical at the Oasis. \n\nWRONG. We had a 35-minute wait despite many open tables that were obvious EVERYWHERE. So we went to the inside bar to the left (the upstairs bar was not open) where the tables were too high for the stools.  I thought it may be a fluke--like, just with our table--but they were ALL out of proportion--what professional establishment does that? Then there was **NO** wait staff--so I went up an ordered three margaritas and a lemon drop.  The \"deer-in-the-headlights\" bartender looked at me like I had ordered a red-nosed-reindeer fizz! Twenty minutes later (I stood and waited at the bar; again...NO wait-staff), he handed me a \"lemon drop\" in a weird-two-tiered-wine glass and three margaritas that had about an inch of liquid from the top of the glass.  NO lime garnish, lemon garnish, sugar-rim...NOTHING!  BAR-TAB: $42 for those crappy drinks. \n\nThen we were seated to the top-left area--despite the fact that there were tables open on the decks--right by some (annoying) BRIGHT lights that spotlighted all their broken chairs, tables, junk, etc.  We picked up our silverware rollups and moved one table over thinking the bright lights and garbage heap were giving us the nose-wrinkles.  No.  It was just the whole atmosphere.\n\nFINALLY the waitress greeted us.  Supplied us with water. We ordered chicken fireballs as an appetizer, then salads, lettuce cups, carnitas enchiladas. A piddly pile of chicken balls are to our table--barely warm.  (We ordered these about a year ago, and I recall the quantity being about double!) The \"carnitas enchiladas\" was just meat rolled in a flour tortilla--no cheese, no sauce, nothing.  Salad was room-temp greens, salad dressing (jalape\u00f1o ranch) was store bought with chopped peppers. Lettuce cups were edible, but not very flavorful.\n\nNEVER, EVER, AGAIN will I waste my money here.  Buy bottled beer--even their \"Kendall-Jackson\" Chard tasted like Francia boxed wine.", "date": "2015-11-18 17:24:15"}

When he walked by I asked him if our ranch was coming out and he told me to ask my server for the ranch. When our food came out, we found a hair in the fish tacos.

My conflict matches the inharmonious nature of this place perfectly. Allow me to explain. (Grab a drink first, I have a lot to say about this place.) \n\nMy daughter is a new resident of Austin and she wanted to spend her birthday somewhere special, interesting, unusual. The Oasis on Lake Travis is a well-known tourist attraction, so it fit the bill. Reviews are so mixed, however, that before you even arrive, you already have a sense of apprehension. We told ourselves that we were coming for the view (particularly at sunset) that everyone raves about. Let's start there. \n\nLake Travis is a man-made lake created by the construction of a dam. It is vast (65 miles) and from The Oasis' position high up on a cliff, you get a very nice panoramic view. Yes, I said \"very nice.\" Admittedly, it was somewhat cloudy on the day we visited. However, the sun did peek out of the clouds just in time for the sunset--and it was, indeed, lovely. Yes, I said \"lovely\". \n\nHere's the thing. It took me a bit to realize why people were so in awe of the view, while our reaction was, \"That's nice.\" There aren't many bodies of water in central Texas where one can view spectacular sunsets. Hailing from the northeast, spending summers at the shore and vacationing all over the world, we've seen a lot of gorgeous sunsets against the backdrop of natural bodies of water. So we weren't quite as impressed.\n\nThe food is the next big topic of debate in reviews. The daughter ordered mahi mahi ($26), and despite not being a huge seafood fan, thoroughly enjoyed it. The husband and I each ordered a different burger ($14), and were quite satisfied as well, though the waffle fries were not even warm. (Note that everything you order in Austin is spicy, \"They sneak it in there,\" quipped the daughter. Indeed, jalapenos are as common as salt, so ALWAYS ask how spicy the dish is if hot hot hot isn't your thing.) Prices were a tad high for a regular restaurant, but not for a touristy spot IMO. Drinks were very well made, not watered down, and at $12 for a souvenir, hurricane glass-sized cocktail, $8.50 without, fairly priced.  \n\nAtmosphere: You can park within the complex (in spots or in a garage, it seemed) or the parking lot across the street. We chose across the street and it was a quick walk to the entrance. As you come upon The Oasis, you are taken in by the beauty of the foliage and massiveness of the large, stone complex with signage alerting you to stores, a brewery, gift shop, etc. At that point, the \"tourist trap\" reputation is understood. \n\nWe were there on a Monday evening and it wasn't very busy. We noticed several decks outside with empty tables. Great! No lines means no wait, right? Nope. We still had to wait about 45 minutes. Apparently, they close off certain sections on weekdays. This was strike #1. How can you make people wait \"45 minutes to an hour\" when you have DOZENS of empty tables? \n\nStrike #2 came from talking with the hostesses. Zero social skills. They don't smile and don't make you feel welcome. If it hadn't been for the 40 minute drive to get there, we might have turned around and walked out. (Bad service is another common--and deserved--complaint about the restaurant. But as it is a popular destination, I imagine management doesn't really care.)\n\nStrike #3: While you wait at the bar, you cannot order anything but cocktails. No food, appetizers, snacks, nothing. You have to wait up to an hour and can only drink. SMH. \n\nStrike #4: They text you when your table is ready. When we got up to the hostess stand, there was a long line of people waiting to put their names on the wait list. WE HAD TO WAIT IN THIS LINE TO BE SEATED. How absurd is that?!\n\nStrike #5: Our table was right in the path of the stairs leading from the inside to the sunset viewing area. As people repeatedly walked by banging into our chairs, we couldn't help but wonder what fool decided that was a good place for a table.\n\nStrike #6: Our server left menus, then didn't return. I had to get up and ask for someone to take our orders. EDITED: I should have mentioned that a manager (I assume) took over and was very attentive. Our waitress did return eventually, apologized and seemed flustered. The place, overall, just seems very poorly run.\n\nThe complex has multiple levels, including at least 3 viewing decks, 2 bars, 2 dining rooms, a stage area, brewery, and shopping section. (Sidenote: no one was quite sure when the brewery was open, where or when the advertised live music was played or where some of the pinpoints on the establishment's wall map were located.) The best way to describe the decor is frenetic. Something to see no matter where you look, none of it matching. Arabian style hanging lanterns, a giant animated jalapeno pepper, lighted peacocks, Grecian-looking statues, tiki hut, a monkey on a banana. No sense of style or consistency. Doing their part to keep Austin weird, I suppose.", "date": "2018-08-21 06:32:15"}

There were no long lines like there are during the evening times. The drinks are adequate and the food is a little pricey but overall it is a nice experience. At the end of the day, it may seem as if you are paying more for the view than the quality of food.\n\nWe experienced slight disappointment with our food: we were not allowed to make substitutions to the Shrimp Diablo and the mixed vegetables were not cooked. Kirby insisted on accommodating us but we declined. Her willingness to get me more steamed vegetables was enough for me. We still enjoyed the overall experience of Oasis and would definitely be returning when were out in Austin during date night/day! \n\nI sent out the pics I took of the lake and my wife to my family and friends. Now they want me to take them here as well. Sounds like a group adventure which I absolutely love.", "date": "2018-06-30 17:55:30"}

It was crazy busy, probably because it was a Saturday on a holiday weekend and we were a party of 7 but anyway. Staff seemed super frazzled and frustrated. From the person who checked us in to the girl who walked us to the table, there was just a rushed and negative energy. \n\nDespite the ladies we interacted with initially, our server was AMAZING. I didn't get his name but I really wish I had. My grandmother is sick and was visibly uncomfortable settling in and he made it a point to let her know that he would get her anything she needed. It was such a kind gesture and only took a second on his part. I really appreciated that. He seemed really busy and was still able to be attentive to us and make sure we had whatever we needed. \n\nThe food was good, nothing out of this world. It came out quick and everything was exactly how we wanted it, modifications and all. We were lucky enough to get a table overlooking the lake so we enjoyed the view during lunch. \n\nAll in all, I probably wouldn't go back expecting too much.

After inquiring about our wait, the hostess offered to seat us immediately. I shrug it off. Ok cool, We're starving. We walk around half the restaurant as the hostess leads us to not one, not two, but three dirty tables and then gives up on her search and tells is to sit down at the dirty table and she would clean it. Not so cool, but like I said, we're starving! As soon as we sit down, our waitress walks up and says something like, \"do you guys wanna wait or something?\" And sneers at us for sitting at her dirty table. Oh, H-E-double hockey stick NO!!!  Needless to say, the tone was set for the rest of our visit to this establishment. No attempt was made to smooth things over, and our waitress was so rude, she eventually left us to our own accord to find someone to get us our check. \n\nWhat a let down.

I called in advance to check on their availability (they don't take reservations so just precaution). When we parked there, there was a shuttle available so that's a nice plus. They was no wait and we actually got seated within 5 minutes. Now the breakdown:\n\nLocation: The view is amazing. I've been to Austin before for hiking/boating/etc and this was actually one of the best views of Lake Travis/Austin. 5/5\n\nFacility: A lot of outdoor seating with umbrellas included for those who hate the sun beaming down. Fans also are there with light water blowing so that was nice as well. A real downside is the downstairs restrooms. The men's restroom was poorly maintained and trash was filled with a ton of paper. Overall, 4/5.  \n\nFood/Drinks: Reading previous reviews, I would have to say I cannot argue: The food here is ok. I ordered the Shiner Bock Pork Fajitas and I will say it's nothing special. Pork did not seem as moist and almost seemed a little bland. Chips and queso were average at best. I also asked for what is available on local draft beers and they only mentioned 1 IPA. That is not a very broad selection. On top of all this, the food here is way overpriced ($16-$17 for fajitas???). I get the experience value but On the Border and other Tex/Mex places are cheaper and offer better food. Overall, 2/5.\n\nService: Our waiter was nice in the beginning but I don't feel he was really engaged. He forgot to give us water at times and took almost 10 minutes to get a to-go box. He seemed to be going through the motions. Side note: Even the staff photographer didn't seem that thrilled to ask to take a picture. Maybe they're more on top of their game when it's more crowded. 3/5\n\nRandom: The gift shop stays open as long as the restaurant is open. Don't pay attention to the website hours, stop by there anyway to make sure.\n\nSo this was my longest review ever. If you're looking for a place with a great view, this is a good place. I do wish the overall experience (Food, facility, service) was similar to the website (website was presented well). Overall, 3/5 (It may not average out correctly but oh well). I would love to update this to a better rating next time I stop by.", "date": "2016-07-06 03:55:19"}

The food is in the Tex-Mex style and is casual but very good. Not the best, but very good. The place was really, really crowded. We waited an hour for a table for 8It was also quite noisy and quite hectic. There is indoor as well as outdoor seating. I'd say the place probably seats somewhere between 800 and 1000 people at a time spread across many balconies. Service was hectic as well. The deal here is the view. You just cannot beat the view. The place is built like a eight or 10 story castle hanging off the side of a mountain with fabulous eclectic artwork spread everywhere throughout the facility. Music is playing constantly and the place is really hopping. This is a great people watching place. They have a huge multi story parking garage adjacent. The prices are a little high but fair. Services As I said is a bit hectic. The restrooms are clean and plentiful. They have several bars playing music and dispensing drinks like there's no tomorrow.

We had a nice spot outside and our server was wonderful. He was always paying attention. After 10-15 mins , my daughter was feeling very cold , so we requested the server to see if he could move us to a place where there was heater. He said the waiting staff would come and help us out. We waited for 5-10 mins and then the waiting staff came out with a pretty fowl attitude. We were smiling all throughout, dint quite understand why she seemed irritated. She asked us to grab our food and she would show us the table. I found that really weird. I dint quite understand why would she or some one else would not help us with moving the food and drinks to our new table. Any ways ,we took all the stuff and asked her where is she seating us. She then said , we would need to wait again , and she would go and check in the front. This is bizarre , why would you make us pick all the stuff and make us wait at the entrance to the patio , when you haven't yet  figured out the table. After waiting for 5 mins , I made my way inside to find her. She saw me and asked me to follow her to the table. This was inside and at some corner. We were fine since my daughter was warmer. We dint have any water on the table . The new server assigned to our table barely checked on us. We got done quickly and paid in cash cause we dint want to keep waiting for the Credit card receipt.

This place makes you feel like you really want to enjoy this , but some waiting people/servers carry a bad attitude around.I have no idea why would you behave like this when we have been so nice.

These folks must take pride in their poor service. Like a commercial says, \"Hey, they don't give us 2 stars for nothing!\" \n\nI live only 3 miles away and WOULD NOT recommend this place to anyone living in town or visiting Austin.\n\nThe OASIS is a collective of restaurants, bars, Ice cream shops, and specialty gift shops.\n\nTHIS REVIEW PERTAINS TO THE MAIN RESTAURANT CALLED \"The Restaurant at The Oasis\".\n\nMy son and I arrived at 8:45 pm on a Tuesday evening for a summer dinner of just appetizers -- this was July, 2019. -- just recently. We hadn't been to the OASIS for nearly four years because of our last experience. We thought we'd give it a second chance and see if it had improved since our last visit in 2015.\n\nIT HASN'T....\n\nWe were told we would be seated in about 20 minutes because the kitchen would close right after 9:00 pm. The host said generally speaking the wait for a table is 40 minutes, but because we arrived just before 9:00 pm we'd be seated faster. She took my phone number and said we'd get a text when the table was ready.\n\nThe restaurant was moderately busy with many groups and couples already leaving when we arrived.\n\nIt was the only restaurant at the OASIS that was open despite all of the signs in the windows of the shops, bars, and other restaurants saying they were all open until 11:00 pm weekdays in the summer.\n\nTo our surprise the entire complex was dark and closed - abandoned really -- even when it said they were open. \n\nThis was just a regular week night too.\n\nWe sat inside the restaurant and waited for a text but it never came. \n\nAfter 50 minutes of waiting and noticing the entire restaurant was clearing out we asked why we hadn't been seated.\n\nThree of the young 20 somethings at the front desk were just chatting and getting ready to close down. Their response was \"you didn't get a text?\" And I replied no. They then said, \"it's not our fault\". The kitchen was now obviously closed.\n\nWe left immediately and went to another restaurant on 620 that was willing to seat us.\n\nAround Austin the OASIS is well know for sloppy service and generally poor tasting meals. If you want to buy just their alcohol and take in the view then fine, but drinks there are expensive too.\n\nI would not recommend this location or the restaurants here to anyone. The view of Lake Austin is great, but everyone in Austin knows this place is terrible. They don't care. Management isn't present, and service is poorly lacking.\n\nDon't waste your time or money at the OASIS.", "date": "2019-07-10 04:08:45"}

We accepted the fact that there would be a wait at 3pm on a Sunday and walked into one bar only to be turned away and told to go to the other  - Strike #2. Finally got a text that our table was ready and then told to go to the end of the line to wait for the table we'd already waited 30 mins for - Strike #3. We were seated, ordered food and were served within a reasonable amount of time. BUT, the nachos were cold, cheese unmelted and the chicken was not fajita chicken, rather small cubes ... that were cold #4  Why two stars?

What restaurant with gorgeous views and $5 valet parking doesn't make food to order? The plate was sent back and I waited while my veggie burger and fruit baked in the heat.\n\nWaiter comes back and says they can't make the enchiladas without onions, so my date asks to look for a menu again. He proceeds to ask the waiter if certain dishes have onions in them when the waiter asks if he is allergic or just doesn't like onions. HOW RUDE! What on earth does it matter? I'm a vegetarian--I'm not allergic to meat, but I don't eat it and I would probably not have a good reaction to it if I did.

He was instructed to seat us at table 122, which was apprently already taken up, so thinking quickly he took us to another table (136, I believe) only to find that the table had not been bussed yet. Being courteous and trying to do his best, the young man seated us at a larger top table rather than having us awkwardly saunter back indoors to wait for a table ... Which is what should've happened in the first place to avoid all of this. \n\nOnce seated at the larger table, a few minutes pass before one female who had been standing at the hostess stand earlier comes by to give us a strange look and proceeds to ask if we had been seated there by someone, we respond \"yes,\" but what we were thinking was, \"no, we just happened to stroll right past the host stand while being somehow undetected, grabbed menus from wherever it is they are held, and grabbed the first table we saw (which by the way was not easily visible).\"\n\nAnyway, some more time passes and a different female who was also standing at the hostess stand earlier decides to come and rather than say, \"someone will be with you shortly,\" or, \"someone will be right over to take your order,\" she decides to ask the same question we had already been asked once more, only this time with a more annoyed tone. She then proceeded to inform us that we could not sit at that table because it was meant for larger groups (despite us not asking to be seated there) and informed us that there were no tables for two available at that moment. She then began to ask if we would mind moving before immediately doing a double take to instruct us to move because, apparently, there was a party waiting for a large table (one that we, again, did not ask to be seated at). \n\nBy this time we were both frustrated and irritated with the situation and asked to speak to the manager, we were escorted to the host stand and asked to wait there for the manager to arrive about 5 minutes later. \n\nTo the manager's credit, he did listen to us and offered to find us a table quickly but by that point the whole experience had left a sour taste, we opted to leave and told him we just wanted to inform him so it didn't happen to others in the future. \n\nThankfully, we hit up Lupe Tortilla instead where we were treated to food that may have been a bit more expensive but was likely much better and, most importantly, we were not asked to relinquish our seats. We then topped it off with a visit to Austin Beerworks... Just sad to say that The Oasis has been ruined for us. \n\n1 star for the view.", "date": "2019-03-22 05:11:39"}

We went for lunch last saturday at around 1: PM. We had been before including the pre fire operation and always were satisfied with our experience. When we approached the front door, a young staffer was cleaning the glass and opened the door to let us enter. We were immediately greeted and brought to a table outside at the edge of the deck with an unobstructed view of the lake. The tables were shaded with umbrellas and our hostess adjusted the umbrellas to provide complete coverage for all. Other staffers adjusted the umbrellas as needed without being asked. We ordered and recieved drinks promptly and we asked a few questions about the menu which our server answered completely (Our guests were from the Northeast and not completely familiar with Tex Mex cuisine). The food we recieved was properly served and attractively presented. I had the shrimp tacos and they were very fresh and excellent. The shrimp remained crisp and tender inside their light batter coating. All vegetables were fresh and unblemished. We were visited by a very competent floor manager who was checking for customer satisfaction. Our server also frequently checked on us and adjusted the umbrellas for our comfort. The day was sunny and hot, but the constant breeze and the umbrellas kept us comfortable. The prices were higher than we would pay for the same items in Austin. The food was as good or better than we have had at some Austin destinations. The service was impeccible and the setting was spectacular. People who complain about the prices are not considering that this is a unique place to dine and there is a price for that. Our guests could not stop exclaiming about the whole experience.

There were 6 in our party, 3 meals came out about 8 minutes before the others - that makes for an awkward situation at the table. \n\nLet's be honest, you go to The Oasis for the view - 2nd time in 4 months I've gone and the wait for an outside table was 45 minutes, so we opted to sit indoors, however there were entire levels of outdoor seating unused and closed off. Why can't guests sit in those outdoor areas? \n\nFood was meh at best, our server was a robot just trying to keep up with all her tables. It was a disappointing experience and won't be going back. It's just not worth the drive. The only reason I gave 3 stars was because of the beautiful, lush garden in front of entrance, the incredible sculptures, the lake and sunset view.\n\nI REALLY wish this restaurant would get their stuff together but I suspect it won't ever happen considering how long theses exact same complaints have been coming in.

I love the staff, the view is amazing and it feels like you're in a different world on a nice sunny day.\n\nThe big news is that the enchiladas are back! It was pretty odd that a Mexican restaurant did not have enchiladas but you have to remember the Oasis is one of a kind. It is in fact the largest restaurant in the United States not attached to a hotel. The multiple decks and locations made it very challenging to bring enchiladas out consistently hot. \n\n(Another problem which I did not understand until they explained is that it is not legal for a restaurant to microwave your food. So basically if they get the food to you cold because of the long distance the runners move and then you asked it to be reheated, they actually have to remake it. Then you end up eating later than anyone else you're sitting with and it makes for a tough dining experience. ) \n\nIn any event they're trying again and we were there opening night. They were hot and great and hopefully when the crowds come they'll be able to handle it. \n\nTo be totally honest the Oasis  is the place you go to to drink margaritas and sit back and enjoy the view. If you understand that and especially if you asked for a shot of Grand Marnier in your margarita I promise you'll have a great experience. \n\nMatt P \n\n\n\n\nFull disclosure. I live at this property. Literally. There is a subdivision that has its entrance between the parking lots. I come here year round and I am here in mornings walking dogs before it opens. I am good friends with the owner but I pay for my meals -I do not wait in line much though.\n\nThe restaurant grounds are magnificent. Beau Theriot is a decorator and has outfitted the homes of very famous people. Take some time and look at the grounds, the statues and the landscaping. He has great pride in the appearance and it shows. You can spend the day looking for statues.\n\nThe views are phenomenal.\n\nThe staff - I know them personally are hardworking very nice young (and some older) people who really try hard. Beau has tried hard over the years to get the best team and I think he is there now.\n\nBeau is also very generous and has personally donated a lot of resources to Austin Smiles a charity that takes surgeons to undeveloped countries to surgically repair congenital facial defects. He has donated money and has personally gone as a volunteer to these countries.\n\nHe has also helped countless young adults as they had jobs at this iconic restaurant. \n\nThe food is better now with an updated menu. This restaurant is the largest in the US not attached to a hotel. It serves food on the level of a cruise ship on holiday weekends. The menu is now designed to help this challenge.\n\nThe best part is the margueritas and the views.\n\nI would strongly suggest visiting this restaurant. Take time to absorb the grounds and the decorations \n\nTell them you want the perfect Melt down with extra grand Mariner \" the Matt and Sherry \" . \n\nEnjoy the view ask for Matt and Sherry's marq", "date": "2020-02-15 20:18:50"}

Beth was phenomenal through the whole process and I don't want this to disregard that AT ALL but a  couple weeks before the wedding I found out she would be at a bridal convention on the day of my wedding until 3pm or so. She ended up cancelling those plans but it still made me feel like I was on the back burner. I'm your bride THAT DAY. A convention comes second to me or send someone else. Maybe management was sending her and if they were, shame on them because THANK GOD she was there because it ended up storming during the time the ceremony was to go and she knew the right second to send me out for the perfect \"after the storm\" sunset. \n2. It realllllly irked me when Beth left my reception and left some kids in charge and instead of discretely asking me which card to use for the bar tap they waited until we were ON THE BUS to go back to the hotel after our sparkler departure at midnight  and came ONTO THE BUS and pulled my dad off the bus to pay the tab. Soooo unprofessional and just plain disrespectful. The father of the bride and my new husband had to EXIT the bus, walk back into the venue, and pay the tab when they HAD MY CARD ON FILE. 50 people were wondering what was going on. I was so embarrassed. They need to hire people with a BRAIN if they're going to allow Beth to leave mid reception. \n3. I hired DigiKnot for cameras for the tables for guests could take photos. I ordered ten cameras and ended up with nine. I KNOW no one from my small wedding would steal a camera. I was looking back on the photos and there were photos of employees in the catering office, proving that they were taking the cameras into the office (one photo attached). I truly believe someone that worked there took it and maybe forgot to return it or plain stole it. I had to pay $150 for that camera. Not cool at all. Especially because I donated allllll of my table decor to The Oasis. This truly does not sit well with me. \n4. AC in the bridal suite DOES NOT WORK. Everyone was sweating alllll day. \n5.

Well drink (Tequila & Cranberry Juice) -- it was just right. \n\nFood: Stacked Enchiladas -- I ate everything except the tortillas pretty much. Everything tasted good but wasn't something worth coming back for. \n\nWould I come back? No, the overall experience just wasn't what I expected.

I even throw from Houston to Austin to go visit this restaurant. Upon arriving to the restaurant, we were told that the wait would be an hour and a half to two hours. We said no problem, will enjoy the view. Unfortunately, it turns out that all the doors were locked to the exterior, therefore we couldn't even enjoy the view. \n\n     When we were finally seated, it literally took 35 minutes to get our drinks to the table. I noticed this place only places a fork in your silverware package. I use a knife when I eat in order to avoid using my fingers to push food onto my fork, which is what most well mannered people will do. I asked the waitress for a knife, to which he answered knives only come with the entrees that require a knife! Imagine that! Since I ordered a burger, I guess I didn't warrant having a knife.\n\n     The prices at this restaurant are among the most expensive that I have seen for this level of food. I ordered a hamburger that was served to me in a plastic basket like if I was visiting Dairy Queen, but unfortunately this sub-par hamburger cost me $13.95! If you wanted to add a couple of slices of jalapeno it would cost you another $2! The fries were extremely cold and leathery, and to be honest with you this hamburger and fries combo was not even on par with Whataburger. My wife's entre consisted enchiladas that look like they came out of a frozen TV dinner, and without exaggeration came with about 3 tablespoons of rice and 1 tablespoon of guacamole for the bargain price of $13.95. Oh and by the way, this place has the distinct honor of having the most expensive sodas I've ever seen in a restaurant before! Each soda costs a whopping $3.50!!!!\n\n     Not considering the view and where we were at I could understand getting a galaxy on prices for the location. The food quality was horrendous but what made this experience worth was the fact that it took over an hour for our food to come to the table! No exaggeration! I gently tried to hint to the waitress by asking her \"how's everything going in the kitchen\" to which she responded I don't know I'm not allowed to go into the kitchen! The poor waitress didn't even understand what I was alluding to!!!\n\n     To sum up the review I would say that this place without exaggeration is probably one of the three or four worst restaurant that I have ever been to. He cost for this level of food are ridiculous, the service is horrendous, and I am frankly surprised that this place is still in business. I would recommend that you come to look at the sites, but please stay away from the food. Do yourself a favor go to Whataburger, and get a $5 cheeseburger that will blow this $14 hamburger away! This place is awful!", "date": "2016-01-17 07:37:32"}

It was gorgeous.  \nSo the restaurant- we were seated and I saw two tables along the railing across from us that had a direct view so I ask if I can be seated there when it was cleaned off. One table ONLY had two dishes on them. The answer was no and that I'd have to be put back on the waitlist if I wanted that table? The table was maybe 4 steps away from us, so of course I'm staring at the tables once they are cleaned off and other people are seated there after about 15 minutes. It was so off putting. Something so simple as good customer service? \nThe menu is very basic we ordered nachos and the shrimp diablo. I do not like cilantro so I asked about cilantro in the dish and was told there was none. My rice had cilantro in it....so I only ate the shrimp which was actually good. The nachos my friend barely touched. The lady who dropped our food off literally Dropped our food on the table lol such an odd experience! She came and dropped it down and mot even in front of us.

Had friends visiting from CA and on our tour of memory lane of my beloved Austin and from what I remember from my last visit to this spot 10 years ago - they had great views of the lake. I recall the food being meh, so was not surprised and I had set my guests expectations there. \n\nFirst, when you call ahead to ask for a party of 12, when is the best time to arrive... because they don't take reservations. The hostess said 7, so to be conservative we showed up at 6:30. Even then we were told it would be 45-60 for table outside. Ok, reasonable enough.  At the 1-hour mark, I went to  ask the hostess about the wait - she was incredibly rude and basically laughed at me for even asking. She even said it could be another hour! We should have left and this would be the end of the nightmare. But I didn't. We were sat at 8 pm at a table in front of fans that were so strong our sunglasses and me yes we're flying off the table - had to be hurricane level wind from their fan! Seriously the hostess struggled with putting stuff on the table. Thankfully they turned it off. \n\nThe waiter took more than 15 mins to great us and finally took our drink and app order. The queso arrived before drinks and chips! Ok, no biggie. We ordered by 8:30 pm. By 8:50 we started to ask about how much longer and could we at minimum get the kid food first. At 9:32 pm the first wave of food arrived... adults only! Nothing for the children who were beyond their breaking point. 9:45 part of the kids food arrive and 10 pm all the food had arrived. \n\nWe had to request twice for management to speak with us -- the guy that did bother to show up laughed at me. I was not amused. They said they would \"take care of us\" and gave us $125 off our meal. Ok, but when they charged my credit card it was a $30 adjustment ???? They then said they would adjust it for us and charged my credit card AGAIN for $32. They would not show me a receipt that refunded the $144 they already charged me. Needless to say there was N0 discount and I will make it my mission to see this place end. Wow! I have to say in my adult years this was the Worst. Place. Ever. Be warned  - this is not a place to take anyone if you want them to like Austin or Texas. \n\nI sent their management a detailed complaint as per request of the manager on duty and have zero response.

The chips were likely from a bag and the salsa was bland and watery. I shared some guacamole with a friend and it was ok but not great and the multi color tortilla chips it came with were stale and gross. I had three margaritas and they had little to no alcohol in them (margaritas usually hit me kind of hard) and at $9 each that's a huge problem. The service was ok. Not bad not stellar but I can't really complain. The worst part is I paid $60 for myself to eat a disappointing dinner and drink some weak margaritas and look at a nice view. I definitely feel gypped.", "date": "2016-05-31 03:25:33"}

I had heard so many things about the place, but had not made it over there in the 19 months I've lived in Austin.  Got to say, the view was fairly amazing.  HOWEVER...\n\nDO, call ahead, it apparently cuts the wait in half.  The wait was apparently supposed to be 45 minutes with the call ahead, but it took us a full hour to be seated.\n\nThe parking was bad:\nDO, use valet.  It's $5 and it will cut your wait and seek time for a parking space by a lot.  Watch out for bad Austin drivers, they tend to not know where they're going.\n\nThe service was terrible:\nThe line to pick up a BEEPER to get seated took about 15 minutes.  Then we waited at the outdoor bar area for at least 1 hour.  It took us over 30 minutes to have a server come over and take our order.  We asked multiple servers and busboys to find out who is covering our area.  No one seemed to know who was covering it.  In fact, we had to harass waiters and busboys for them to even acknowledge our existence.  Everyone seemed to be new to The Oasis.  It was maddening.  Finally, we got our appetizer order in and about 15 minutes later it was dropped off.  Very mediocre.  I seriously think that the salsa was Pace Picante.\n\nAround 8:30ish we finally get seated.  First one waitress came by and picked up our drink order.  Then 15 minutes later another waiter came by and asked for our drink order...which we had already given.  \n\nAnyways, the communication between the wait-staff seemed non-existent.  A little while later we all gave our order.  I told the waiter that I was a vegetarian and all.  He made some recommendations.  I picked up the cheese enchilada's and black beans.  When he dropped off the order he goes \"I made sure the black beans don't have meat\" and then he placed the plate of chicken enchiladas and charro beans in front of me.  Unfortunately, I was engaged in a conversation at the time and didn't touch my meal until after my buddy had eaten an entire cheese enchilada (apparently he was wondering where the chicken was).  The food was very mediocre.\n\nAnyways, long story short, AWFUL service, huge crowds (seats 2400), bad food, but decent drinks and an unbeatable view.  I would not recommend this restaurant for anything else then a few drinks.", "date": "2009-05-12 14:14:37"}

The seasoning was off because there was no bold flavors. I wanted something flavorful, but I was given a dish that was just a disappointment. The crawfish sauce did not do much for the dish. It had a lumpy consistency and did not taste like crawfish.\n\nSOUTHWESTERN LETTUCE WRAPS- fresh lettuce cups, diced grilled chicken, black bean and corn salsa, fresh avocado, and sweet chile dressing\nThe lettuce wraps was the worst thing I've ever eaten! The flavors were bland and one noted. I thought the sweet chile would add some sweet or spicy addition to the dish, but it didn't. The corn salsa didn't have that crunch that I would've liked and the chicken also didn't have much flavoring to it either.\n\nOverall, this place was a huge disappointment.

An added touch was the cute and instagrammable worthy decor and unique personal touches, such as writing on the walls in sharpie and adding your lock. \nOur service was not terrible, and I've seen a lot of negative reviews about the service. Our waitress was friendly and timely and we always had refills before we ran out.

It did take awhile for our food to come out. \nWe had no trouble parking, and even hitched a ride with someone driving people in for tips. \nThe menu was a little weird, I wasn't positive of what to expect. Burgers, salads, fajitas, and random Mexican dishes. I had Sabanna de Pollo which was a chicken breast slathered in quest with grilled peppers. The bean options were different but didn't taste bad. The rice was really good. The fajitas in our party weren't bad but maybe a little bland. It didn't taste like fajitas back home, kind of lacked authenticity... or maybe I just can't grasp \"Tex-Mex\". You could keep your cups that the drinks cake in. \nThe gift shop had cute and unique finds, a lot of which highlighted local artists and local popular landmarks. I spent a solid $45 on things to bring back home, but I'm also a sucker for souvenirs. \nOverall, it was a good experience. Was the food the best I've ever had? Nah.

I live at this property. Literally. There is a subdivision that has its entrance between the parking lots. I come here year round and I am here in mornings walking dogs before it opens. I am good friends with the owner but I pay for my meals -I do not wait in line much though.\n\nThe restaurant grounds are magnificent. Beau Theriot is a decorator and has outfitted the homes of very famous people. Take some time and look at the grounds, the statues and the landscaping. He has great pride in the appearance and it shows. You can spend the day looking for statues.\n\nThe views are phenomenal.\n\nThe staff - I know them personally are hardworking very nice young (and some older) people who really try hard. Beau has tried hard over the years to get the best team and I think he is there now.\n\nBeau is also very generous and has personally donated a lot of resources to Austin Smiles a charity that takes surgeons to undeveloped countries to surgically repair congenital facial defects. He has donated money and has personally gone as a volunteer to these countries.\n\nHe has also helped countless young adults as they had jobs at this iconic restaurant. \n\nThe food is better now with an updated menu. This restaurant is the largest in the US not attached to a hotel. It serves food on the level of a cruise ship on holiday weekends.

I ordered the classic american burger: no tomato, onion or pickles, add cheese. It came with tomato and pickles. No lettuce or cheese. I was upset, because of the inane wait time, and because they basically gave me the opposite of what I ordered. The burger was quite good but I was disappointed that my order was wrong. The waffle fries were fine but I got a bunch of crumbs instead of big normal fries. \nIn conclusion, my experience at the Oasis on Lake Travis was lack luster and overrated.

I'm on crutches and she is a high-risk pregnancy, so this definitely wasn't our wisest move and the line is extensive, but one of the employees pulled us out of the line after waiting about 20-25 minutes and brought us to a table on one of the upper decks. We did not ask for that and were (mostly) prepared for the 2.5 hour wait we were told it would be, but she went out of her way to seat us sooner which was greatly appreciated! \n\nThe view here is stunning, so it's a place I'd recommend for anyone visiting Austin, even if you only come for chips, salsa, and a drink to knock you off your feet (hello, Uber my old friend! But really, they limit every guest to TWO hurricanes here! Oh, and they come in a commemorative glass you can take home) \n\nThat being said, The Oasis has the BEST SALSA I have found in Texas and I've lived here my whole life. It is the perfect amount of chunky veggies with the right amount of heat and tastes insanely fresh! I could drink this stuff (it's really that good..) \n\nI ordered the Vegetarian Stuffed Poblano and it was fairly tasty. I do wish it came with more beans/rice because it's a little spicy, but the pepper itself is a huge size and the flavors are very good. It would be lovely if they added a meat option because that would make it even better, but I would still order this again. \n\nFor drinks, I ordered a Mango Perfect Margarita and one of the Hurricanes since my friend was driving. The margarita was tasty but didn't have much of a kick, but there is a reason they'll only let you have two hurricanes! That puppy was STRONG with a very overwhelming flavor of pineapple. \n\nIf you are planning to come here, I highly recommend making a reservation well in advance to avoid the insane lines, but also be aware that the employees are often assisting an overwhelming number of tables so don't expect them to always be present. They are friendly, but a person can only do so much when they have 20 other tables they're taking care of as well. That being said, they are pretty good at anticipating your needs (extra water, chips, salsa, etc) \n\nThe Oasis is a really cool spot and I would definitely encourage you to check it out! The food is overpriced, but you are definitely paying for the location as well so it's worth it in my opinion. Beautiful, beautiful views and a great dinner spot to watch the sunset. Oh, and they often have live music on the upper floor to listen to while you wait 2.5 hours for your table in the event you forgot to make a reservation. \n\nOkay, so they say they don't take reservations.....but I've definitely had an entire room reserved before so maybe things have changed? \u200d", "date": "2019-06-23 23:52:45"}

They give chips and salsa to begin the meal. The chips tasted like packaged chips and same for the salsa. Albeit we only tried the appetizers, chicken fireballs and queso + guac. The queso for being non-native Texan was alright with good mix of jalape\u00f1os for the kick. The guac is okay, it could do with more jalape\u00f1os and salt. The chicken fireball was recommended to be really good, but it really just tasted like freezer bought buffalo chicken that was probably breaded in house.

I believe it was the same day that Angus swam the entire width of the lake and back in under 3 minutes, and then threw up on Shiny Kyle.  Anyway, we decided after swimming to head over to the Oasis and have some grub before heading home.  There were about 12 of us, and our buddy Cleveland Dave's Parents even showed up, as they were visiting Austin to do some house hunting and wanted to meet all of their son's friends, mostly me.\n\nIt started to cloud up and look stormy during dinner, which added fantastic cloud coloring to the one thing that The Oasis consistently does right, they have the best sunset views in the State.  The food that day, as most other times I have been there, was average to good, and the service, as most other times I have been there, was slow.  All through dinner, we could hear the rumbling of thunder in the background, and Alli kept telling me how she was afraid of being struck by lightning.  I, of course, had to tell her my stories about my friend Shelby who has been struck by lightning and survived twice, about how it probably doesn't hurt much, about how the odds of lightning hitting the deck were pretty high, but hitting her in particular were only slim, as there were lots of taller people hanging out with us.  Needless to say,  this didn't allay her fears much, but I was having a lot of fun teasing her.\n\nAnd then, sometime later that night, after we left, the place got struck by lightning and nearly burned to the ground.

The margaritas are okay. \n\nThe food in general is not that great...this is really just for the view.", "date": "2020-09-23 09:02:08"}

I have been here before a few times, the other times were about 5-10 years ago. The restaurant used to be fantastic, but now it seems like they cannot figure out or accommodate the ridiculous volume of people that visit each night. \n\nI had my bachelorette party in Austin this past weekend and we thought it would be a good idea to eat at the oasis, because I remembered how beautiful and fun it was from my previous visits years ago. My sister tried to book a reservation ahead of time, but spoiler alert-- they don't do reservations. No problem right? It's a big restaurant and we would have been fine with waiting up to an hour for a table while we sip on some margaritas. We got to the parking lot about 6:45 and it probably took almost 30 minutes just to find a parking spot. No luck on the surface lot, so we tried the parking garage. The parking garage was bumper to bumper literally from the entrance to the top. You're really trapped once you're in there because there are no spots and it's just everyone driving to the top then back down once they realize there aren't any. The parking garage is so narrow that it's impossible for trucks to make turns or back out making it even harder for you to get anywhere (You'd think being in Texas they would have anticipated that being an issue). My sister ended up having to drop us off at the front, make another round through the parking garage then finally had to just use valet parking for $7 plus tip. \n\nSo then we finally get to the hostess stand where they inform us the wait time is 2.5 to 3 hours. We wouldn't have been able to sit down to order until 10. We tried their very casual counter service restaurant upstairs but quickly realized we would not be able to find a table. We decided we needed to go to another restaurant entirely since it clearly wasn't working out, which meant we had to go back to the valet and wait for him to get our car (it hadn't been parked very long) and my cousin had to get her car out of that god-awful parking garage. \n\nTo sum it up, just trying to eat there wasted an hour of my life and $10 for parking. I wanted an average restaurant experience with a pretty view, instead I was held hostage by a parking garage.", "date": "2019-08-02 03:32:58"}

We got there early so I that would be fine with us. After waiting almost 2 hours later, I asked for an update. They told me it was going to be another 30 minutes. I explained to them I was tired of waiting and didn't appreciate how they kept extending the wait time (I mean really, who goes to a restaurant and stays at their table for 2 hours??). Here's where I really got upset. I saw people getting seated that arrived AFTER US. Which means, they literally forgot about us. I went back to the hostess and explained the situation. Just out of the blue, they said to a water \"hey can you go bring them to table 10\" or whatever the number was. And also, the table was in a TERRIBLE spot. It was literally pushed out in the corner and we had to squeeze through other tables to get there. Also, the waiter looked like he hated working there. The food and drinks were fine, but he looked very unhappy for some reason. What an embarrassing first impression. When we started to leave I asked for a manager and waited for several minutes.

We had friends in town and we were staying on the Lake for the weekend so figured it would be a perfect place to take everyone. \n\nWe got there and used the valet which was only $7 and since we had a big group and a newborn, this was greatly appreciated.\n\nWe went up to the restaurant and they informed us it would be a 45 minute wait. We expected this and went to the Oasis Brewery for a drink while we waited. The brewery (which has absolutely no connection to the restaurant we found out) was amazing. The drinks were superb and the view was beautiful. I saw that they had food and almost suggested we stay there. I wish I had.\n\nAfter we had ordered our drinks, about 5 minutes into our wait, we got a text that our table was ready. Hard to complain about getting let it 40 minutes sooner than expected so we chugged our beers and headed over to the restaurant.\n\nWe were sat at a long table with plenty of room for us and a great view for almost everyone in our party. The view truly is stunning but so was the view at the brewery.\n\nI asked the waiter which of the Oasis beers they had on tap and if the lineup was the same as the brewery. That's when everything began to go sour. He acted absolutely indignant that I assumed they had their beer and he pointed out vehemently that they have no association with the brewery and in fact were not on good terms at all with each other. I found that very strange and was disappointed that I couldn't enjoy any more of their beers. The beer selection they had in the menu once he pointed it out to me was mediocre at best. Seemed so strange they wouldn't serve the beer from their very close neighbor.\n\nOur waiter up-sold many of my friends on the drinks, clearly pushing them to the top end drinks. That wouldn't be an issue if the drinks were even decent, they were not. They were not even close to the premium we paid for them.\n\nIt just got worse from there. We had two friends ask to split the Fajitas for 1 since they were leaving to go home and couldn't use the leftovers. The waiter, Marcus, was not pleased what-so-ever by this. He began treating us like he wanted to have nothing to do with our table. My friend even mentioned that we would still tip well despite not ordering a ton of food. Knowing my friends, they really would have had the service been even decent. \n\nFrom this point on we barely saw our waiter. He came out once to give us more chips. My friend politely said we were good on chips. We had eaten plenty and appreciate it. He then made one of the most sarcastic and passive aggressive comments I have ever heard a waiter say. He said \"It's ok you barely ordered any food anyways\". I had to confirm with my friend next to me that he actually said that. I was shocked. \n\nMultiple times we tried to find a manager. Our food had not come, Marcus was becoming visibly aggressive and upset, and we were just ready to leave. \n\nIt was absolutely miserable.\n\nFinally our food came and the disappointment even got worse. The fajitas were cold. All of the food was pretty crappy and not even close to worth the price. \n\nThe next time we saw Marcus, which took quite awhile, we asked for the check so we could leave. We just wanted to go home and put this horrible experience behind us. \n\nWe got the bill, which was not small and included an enormous tip. At this point a couple of us wanted to remove the gratuity but the rest just wanted to go home and knew it would take a long time to actually find a manager and get the check corrected. We paid it and tried to put the whole ordeal behind us. \n\nI love leaving positive reviews and really supporting the businesses in Austin. There is almost nothing positive I can say about the Oasis restaurant other than it has a really amazing brewery walking distance from it that has just as good of a view. I recommend going there instead.", "date": "2019-11-05 15:29:00"}

The liberal use of black sesame seeds tried to obscure any details.  The menu mentioned a chimichurri sauce.  Not sure where that was. It was never seen or tasted.  The tuna was not fully cut into large slices, and they did not provide knives.  The vinaigrette was pretty tasty.  The mixed greens were sparse, but fresh.  The mango made a strange combination of flavors.  It would have been a decent dish, if it had been served fresh off the grill.  \n\nWhen ordering, we asked the waiter what the \"mixed greens\" were.  \"Uh, I can tell you that it doesn't have any iceberg in it.\"  Wow.

We had heard this place had an awesome view and some decent drinks so we decided to come try it out. We weren't sure about how good the food would be since i had checked some of the reviews on the place, but we said if it's not terribly busy we'd try it out. \n\nWhen we got here we were seated in a timely manner and placed outside with an incredible view. My boyfriend and i were so excited and couldn't wait to try their margaritas. Our waitress, never got her name, took our drink and food order and that was the last time we had seen her. \nShe never checked on us to see how our appetizers were, never asked if we wanted another drink, she even looked straight at our table while tending to a table full of Caucasian patrons and walked away. \n\nWe were starting to feel like she didn't want to tend to us for who knows what. But our food runner was 10X more welcoming and hospital than our own server. After minutes of still not being checked on we called on a busser to bring the manager over hoping that we could get some kind of compensation for the horrible service. And keep in mind i work in this industry i HATE being that kind of person who has to call a manager over. I understand the other side, but they were not very busy. I assume their rush is around dinner and we were there from 4-5 pm. So there could not have been a legit reason as to why she was not giving us good service. \n\nThe manager finally came over, again never got a name, and asked us if everything was ok. We explained to him that we've been getting poor service and that we drove from Houston specifically to try this place out. He offered to get us a new server and some beers. The gentleman that eventually took over our table was a lot better, we just hate that it was already at the point where we had had enough and wanted to leave. \n\nAside from the horrible service our food wasn't that good, we paid for the fajita combo for two and it wasn't a lot of food. And the margaritas were trash. We went to sixth street after and had a $5 margarita that tasted way better. For the prices, this is not very good Tex mex food. Which we wouldn't have minded the mediocre food if we had better service from the start. \n\nWhen we got our bill we were charged for everything, including the beers the manager brought to us. Even after expressing that we were unhappy with our experience and food. They couldn't have even taken off the chips and salsa off our bill?? The only nice thing about this place is the view. But there's more to do on lake travis than coming to the oasis. Needless to say, we felt very unwelcome there by majority of the staff. And we will not be back.", "date": "2020-08-21 13:56:04"}

I've eaten here probably a dozen times since the late 90s. \n\nI've never had a good meal here. Never! You could excuse an occasional bad meal, but it didn't matter whether it was lunch or dinner. The food always sucked. \n\nI got married here (2nd time) in the late 90s as well. We had about 35-40 people in a comfortable private room. No one expects great food for a wedding but our simulated chicken was inedible for the most part. With the excitement of the event and great company, I wasn't terribly hungry and didn't pay too much attention to the lousy food. The sunset over the lake was fabulous though. \n\nMy son-in-law, who works in the restaurant business called The Oasis a day or two afterwards and politely explained what was wrong with the meal (everything). To their credit they gave us a nice refund for the meal. \n\nYears later when I heard that it burned down, I forwarded the article to my 2nd ex-wife. Like our marriage, The Oasis didn't survive. \n\nWhen it was rebuilt, I heard rumors of a new chef and better food. I've brought some out of town friends here, let's face it, there isn't a better view in the Austin area. Alas, the food still really sucks. I mean you can't even get decent chips and salsa here. Chips are usually stale. \n\nSad that they've been able to keep this sad excuse of a restaurant open only because it has such a great location. Even more sad is the fact that I'll probably go again when I want to show off the beauty of Lake Travis to friends from elsewhere. Wouldn't it be great if they made an effort someday and I didn't have to brag about the view and apologize for the food.", "date": "2014-08-26 23:48:59"}

It was a Saturday, early evening, so we knew there would be a wait but we didn't mind. There was a line just to get to the hostess stand. When the couple in front of us reached the hostess, we heard her offer them immediate seating in the bar area  next to the restaurant where there was live music, or they could wait for a regular table. Then when my boyfriend and I got to her she just handed us a pager and asked for the name. We were both a little weirded out that she didn't offer us any options....we probably should have asked but decided we really didn't care that much, it just seemed very odd. \n\nWe got some drinks and took in the view which was lovely, however, the place was so busy it kind of took away from the ambiance of the view. I had a margarita, which was really delicious.\n\nAt our table, the service was HORRIBLE. this was probably the worst service I have ever had. Our server was not rude, but just very un-attentive and slow. He never took our drink orders and never brought us chips and salsa (after I saw ALL the table around us with some I flagged him down and asked for some). He took forever to come back over to take our food order and our food took forever to come out. By this time the restaurant had slowed down quite a bit.  I am really understanding if servers are busy, what bothered me was that lack of communication. He could have at least come over to apologize for the wait and see if we needed any drinks, but instead, he seemed to just ignore us. Finally our food arrives, and the food was terrible. I got the fajitas, which for around $18 I expected to be really good. I know you pay so much at The Oasis for the view, but I do expect a decent meal. This, however, was pretty bad.  When we were about halfway through with our meals and clearly still eating, the server came over to ask if we wanted any dessert or anything else........I usually like to finish my meal before deciding that. Finally, the night is over and once again we have a long wait for our check. \n\nTheo only good thing about this place is the view and the margaritas.

Won't be recommending this spot to anyone and we came a long way! We came all the way from California to experience one of Austin's highlights, and we hated it. The views from the next door restaurant was nice. Love them. This restaurant is pathetic and we are informing all to STAY AWAY, including the Fairmont concierge. \n\nApparently, you can treat customers like crap since you know they'll come for the view.\n\nThanks for nothing.", "date": "2020-10-08 00:53:38"}

I must say that all the decorations and designs were super cool and really Austin-ish in the sense that it was weird in a cool way. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes before the food arrived and by the time we got outside it was too dark to really see the view that much. The entire time we were there we had to wait long whiles before getting anything we needed. The food was pretty good, but honestly not worth the wait. \n\nI enjoyed my experience and had a good time, but the amount of waiting was crazy. We waited a long time for our food, for our drinks, for chip refills, etc. Being that it's a popular place I understand, but having more staff would easily solve this problem and lead to high guest satisfaction, this shouldn't have been a major issue for a Wednesday. \n\nOverall, had a good time, but way more waiting that it was worth and they also didn't do anything for birthdays which was a disappointment.", "date": "2020-08-14 01:07:23"}

Also, everyone in our group is part of the service industry, so we always try to give places the benefit of the doubt when things go wrong but we most definitely know what to expect when we go eat. Walking up, everything was absolutely stunning. The view was wonderful, and the line outside the door was moving very quickly, shortly to find out there was a wait. Of course, it's sunset time, we didn't expect much less. We went to the bar and ordered drinks- the margaritas taste like straight lime juice which we were so disgusted with we sent it back (which we felt awful for being \"those people\"). 30 minutes into waiting to be sat i noticed there was at least 15 open and clean tables on their patio, and no one is being seated even though the busser was continually yelling to the host there was clean tables. We finally got sat, and we had to ask the family next to us to remove their purses and belongings from our seats. Assuming this table had actually been open long enough for a whole family to put ALL of their belonging on the table. Kenyan came and greated us and we ordered a tea and water the Chicken Diablo appetizer, which came as the same time as our meal, and before our tea and water. Too add to it, we did not get the Shrimp Diablo that was ordered, we got the shrimp tacos. We asked him nicely to fix it, so another 15 minutes later we finally got the $25 5 piece shrimp, average rice, and undercooked vegetables we ordered. There was no prebussing done until the next last second of our meal, empty glasses and plates everywhere even though we stacked them for him trying to help (again, our whole group was full of servers. We do those things). 10 minutes later he came back from dropping off our plates in the dish pit to get our checks. Lastly, after all the trouble and apparent misunderstanding from the server, I asked him why if he had messed up why he didn't discount our food. And yes, we were being those people again. Knowing myself, when I make a mistake on a table, I try to make it up to them. He told me he couldn't discount a table unless they asked for one, which made me more frustrated. You can't walk up to your manager and say \"Hey, I messed up pretty bad and they're a little upset. Would you mind discounting their ticket for me?\" After we finally got THAT taken care of, walking out we heard a couple screaming that they're never coming back and we asked why. Apparently, this restaurant closes right after sundown and wouldn't serve a couple that flew all the way from Virginia to have a nice romantic get away and wouldn't serve them at 8:40 in the evening, which is wild. I've never heard of such a \"high-end\" place closing so early. Moral of the story, food is overpriced to portions but decently good, and the service we got was one I'll never forget and won't be returning for next time we make it to Austin.", "date": "2017-10-19 15:28:32"}

It's tradition.  Sunday evenings splash on the bug spray and head over to the Starlite t\\errace to watch the sunset and salsa dancing, listen to a great band and have margs, beer and nachos.  So what if you have a hard time finding parking and you get pebbles and dust in your flip flops as you're hiking to the place.\n\nWords cannot describe our disappointment at our first, and probably last visit since the renovation is complete.  No more Starlite Terrace??!!! That was the best part.  I've gone inside the restaurant exactly twice in 15 years!!!  We loved it when it was first come, first serve seating on the terrace.  You could just get a drink and stand around enjoying the sites until a table cleared.   Last year someone had the bright idea to have guests wait in the hot sun to be seated--not very cool, but okay, we put up with it.  To give you an idea of how much the regulars loved the Starlite Terrace--one summer evening it started pouring down raining for at least 20 minutes.  NOBODY left!!!\n\nSo now the salsa dancing is on the 2nd floor in a too small, too dark, barlike setting, with only about 10 tables that allow you to hear the music AND enjoy the view.  We were led to our table on one of the decks through a maze of stairs, umbrellas, and too close tables.  The view was good.  But by the time you put up with slow wait staff, barely passable food and drinks, and a trek to your table that is likely to leave  you out of breath, somehow the view isn't enough.\n\nStaff told us that the Starlite Terrace was going to be turned into retail space.
