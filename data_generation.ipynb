       "{1.0: 'I to like this place based on the stunning location We thirty to be sat which I understand but then once sat we and never saw a server The menu was basic bar food so we left without ever getting We went upstairs to the brewery which had the same view and better foodThe view from the deck of the sunset is but everything else about the Oasis is a disaster Anyone who grew up in or went to school here will tell you that the Oasis is as much a staple of as the Capital or Town Lake However the Oasis been a train wreck ever since it was following a massive fire At this point the place is a star facility that cannot make a decent margarita or even serve a decent bowl of chips an unforgivable sin in the city of To skip the prose the food at the Oasis is disgusting and the mixed are terrible My advice to you is to come for the sunset view but order a bottled beer and plan to eat dinner at one of the other awesome food in insteadThis place really bad service with poor seat time because there were like tables open and not for when they could be seating someone and not an hour wait The only good are the view and chickenThis plAce is all but it s horrible Me and my husband tried it because we the view was gorgeous which it was but the food was over priced and we got sick it was style and tasted like it was out of a bagMy family was in town and we have been wanting to try this place Although i checked out the menu It didnt look to exciting I t when we went the food was terrible View awesome food horrible Only come here of you eat and expensive Food is away as well I got the chicken reluctantly they were To my surprise i received about a half a breast Like of And to top it off it taste like plain baked no seasoning at all Not back here unless my in are in town and beg me Its a shame because the restaurant is so unique and a beautiful view Get a new chef please And a unique and exciting menuIt should be if possible We came on Memorial Day at were told wait and at were and shown to a section and was told just pick where you want Odd way to start no given either After min a server came by and for drink and we told her we Finally came back with min later and the water we We ordered and our After she came back and we about our and then was told that her ticket with our order away and she to take our order again more and our finally came out but no food At after we sat down our food came out but only not The server then what we were missing which then took more Obviously she it up again Then more and another runner from the kitchen came out with another plate of which we told him we already had our order At this point we a manager and the situation To his credit he did credit us half our dinner and dessert which we declined Do NOT come for the food or service just look at the view and departThe Oasis restaurant possibly the best view in town coupled with and and What if the food was good What if the tasted better than a of alcohol in a sugary As the premier tourist trap of Greater with revenue I suspect there is little motivation to change Concept someone this place down it and a premium experience from the bottom up view includedThe view is amazing I was so excited to have a nice meal here but after waiting for a table we were seated and the server never came over We before leaving I accidentally left my jacket and my ran back in and our were still on the table We could have been there an hour and nobody would haveIt this restaurant is extremely Our wait was an hour and a half fine its a popular restaurant so we went to the bar for some My tasted awful It tasted like made mix After we got our we decided to check out the and walk around Beautiful I can t argue that but that s when we the tables were maybe full at the most Why do I have an hour and a half wait We decided to leave after that the food people had on their tables just like a mix of sub par food and We the oasis brewing company on our way out and went there for a few So glad we did that instead of waiting at the Oasis It had better ANDI hate to kick a place when they are down but this place was such a dud I have to I used to like taking people here ago for the view The food always been mediocre and the a bit but that was the cost of a great view and a fun place Well the view is gone unless you enjoy looking a dry gulch of rubble and worst of all the new rebuilt Oasis is atrocious I would be embarrassed to bring anybody here The architecture and left me speechless I just t find the to describe it until I saw another review that summed it up perfectly architectural vomit I don t know what the architect and designer were thinking but it is an eyesore RIPThis place the worst service below average food and unclean The view is beautiful but simply not worth it If you must come here have a drink at the bar and leave Some of the we ordered did not even show up and the waiter was for the most partWay Food was not very good Took over an hour after we were seated to even get our food Waitress was rude hostess had gone to get us more She thought we just up to the table and sat down since we t have yet We have were born and raised in and have been here many times We don t plan on going backFirst off we re We read the and thought we don t mind a tourist trap This was the tourist trap to end all tourist traps You drive a half hour from proper into the middle of nowhere Yes Nowhere You re by the lake but don t think you eat then catch a dip t happening Unless you got a helicopter in your back pocket Anyway After walking around the place which was like a million we decide to go inside for a bite Walk up to the twelve year old host and ask for a table two That be that s a long time We ask about the other all within distance of this place Um it s a holiday I m not certain they are open but I m certain that we are Whatever We start to walk then an The bar We go back to and are like Is the bar open seating The bar Yes The bar is open seating We go Find a table Pick up one of the that are sitting on the bar stand in line Yes That s right A bar with a rope line Get to the bartender and drum roll please NO FOOD IN THE BAR We it out of there NEVER TO RETURN AGAIN Horrible service No horrible peopleTerrible service Bartender to be too busy while the bar was empty and one ticket came in per to make to get chips for us No one tried to make the experience better Very sad TerribleThe view is nice the service was good The food however was terrible The were not good either I had the skinny margarita and it was very sweet My husband had a top shelf margarita which was watered down I had a the bun and it was dry as sawdust and really flavorless My husband had a salad which he felt unimpressed with Really this place is a tourist trap and not worth itProbably not a shock to anyone who s been here much but literally the worst service of any place I ever been in any country Food is mediocre View is niceThe food is atrocious The service even worse A manager to our table to intimidate us when we our server had not been seen in min Unless you re sitting on the edge the view t worth itFood is horrible Come by and take a picture then get the heck out Ha Or try the breweryThere for lunch the place is so crowded we for our table for the place was I ordered the fish for to get them in when I got it the fish was dry and base of the fish was horrible never going to go back thereService t what they are known for maybe Ordered a got soda water and mint leaves Took for busser to clear table and food was warm not hot Definitely not worth the foodthis was the worst experience I ever had in min wait to actually get a table once we finally got a table we actually sat for hour and Still no food I have had enough Mother came down from just to experience what I thought was going to be great This is very unprofessional and I honestly will never come back to this place again If I could give this no I absolutely wouldUnfortunately we were those who got trapped into driving out to The Oasis for sunset Big mistake Even the view was disappointing as the lake water is very low due to drought and the evening we were there the sky was very hazy so the sunset was We re from where we have sun sometimes and so while this setting might be spectacular to some it was just to us Perhaps we are spoiled The Oasis is a bit of a drive from downtown and really is quite a tourist trap We were barely acknowledged by a gaggle of snotty sorority like at the front desk who told us there was a minute wait to sit outside but we could be seated immediately inside There were literally standing at the front desk doing nothing but giving us the stink eye seeming to regale in the fact that us tourist could not sit outside We did not come to sit inside but to catch the sunset so we for a table inside the bar that had west facing and we could meander outside to check out the view as we As we sat inside we watched numerous outside tables sit vacant the entire time we were there Whiskey Tango We and for service in the bar and finally went to the bartender to ask if we could order He he t sure but t think anyone was working in our area so if we something to order from him We ordered a couple of and chips and They t screw up the beer later the sun set they rang a bell and that was that We did not order any food as it t look very good and frankly we were ready to leave The experience left a bad taste in our Bottom line it was a waste of time getting out there service was rude to non existence and even the view was Not at allI came here with my from out of town for Sunset We went to the Bar before dinner The Bartender us for a good My friend who was so happy to be there and him twice No response Then he threw down a wet menu for us to order When we tried to order a certain beer beer is not listed on the menu he got even more short if that is even possible and pointed to some dusty beer on the top shelf far away As in those are our Unfortunately we could not see them We ended up getting some and t stay for dinner because of the poor service we received in the barIt s more than obvious that you do not go here for the eats which are frozen commercial out of the can rubbish Hello real food Do not eat here Go for the music and the view the and the dancing Forget about the food unless you like poison at highIt s been a few since I have been to the Oasis this was the first time for dinner The place grown so big its like an amusement park with snaking long to get in We an hour and at for a table in the massive jungle of a restaurant mother days The restaurant was a mess with food on the floor and plenty of un tables We finally were seated at an seat table for our party of This large oval table size made it awkward to communicate with each other When we to be the waitress told us we would have to go back outside and go to the bottom of the wait list Are you She said that s policy We if we could move to an un table beside us and she Oasis totally lost its charm with its bloated new restaurant and management don t customer service is key I will not come backAwful manager Awful Awful Awful food Awful everything t even get to enjoy the view Totally RUINED the last night of our tripThis is a no star restaurant We were seated at a table that had a FILTHY floor to be seated at a different table The waitress said it t be done to have the floor swept It never Worst customer service Will not be coming backThe worst I m not that picky about food I enjoy most everything But this place one for the It s a bit deceiving because from the outside it huge and fun We arrive and are in a large room with tables and scattered about alone Not one person I to move and they the four of us to a better location on a tiny table for people t fit our all on it We move again and the waitress I have no idea who Is in charge here We ordered and they were mediocre Too sweet but drinkable Chips and were decent We ordered They were the worst One tablespoon of for two people Bland low quality meat were cold We had to ask for silverware A We at at the dinner hour It potential But if you are a restaurant you have to be good at FOOD Management do something about your poor foodGreat music great but seriously food is relatively inexpensive to make THE WORST FOOD EVER It used to mediocre edible and worth it because of the food and music But golly really can t you at least make a plate of half decent I am actually willing to pay for mediocre food because of the food and music But this was absolutely pathetic Yeah I come but I WONT EVER BUY FOOD AGAINHow do I begin Well the wait was an hour and a half which t bother me as much since that was considering that we got there during peak time sunset However the experience after we got seated is the reason why I am giving this place star First it took about min just to get with water And another min to get our chips and Then it took another half an hour for the waiter to return to our table to finally take our order The level of attention that the waiter was giving to our table was absent Furthermore the food was mediocre I mean we were full from on chips and since the waiter took so long to get to us Even the chips tasted too oily I would only go there for the view since the restaurant a magnificent view of lake Travis especially during sunset Everything else is not worth the waitI been here plenty of times and always seem to think the food is below average and unfortunately the view is not that great Every time I ask myself why I decided to go again There will never be another time The food is very below average and extremely over priced How is a bowl of the same price as And it was an ice cream scooper size bowl of The real reason I will never set food in this establishment again though is because the food runner spilt my drink all over me all over my phone and inside my purse and our waitress just me if I some more Seriously I understand happen I used to be a server myself The audacity though to not completely apologize help clean it up or even offer me a new or complementary drink is just beyond me So much for southern hospitality Oh wait any at allI wish I were rich so I could open up a of a joint Seriously other than the view what s the point of this place food service Such a shamemy favorite The view of Lake Travis is nice but that does not satisfy my appetite I just can t believe the for such a mediocre place I had the and it tasted like it came straight out of a bag from the grocery store Also this is Those should have been homemade Only came because a friend to come here Next time it s straight to the lakeSo I lived in my whole life within of The Oasis I been plenty of times and never have I been I went last night with my husband who never been I was to show him the venue the only thing that is incredible about the entire complex Food was absolutely terrible so nothing there And the service was poor also I know this is a tourist spot but you would think that knowing how far people drive to get out there and the time it to wait for a spot with a view they would improve their food and their service Not the case There are other on the lake with great Don t waste your time here Sorry OasisTerrible food and horrible service I had a waiter turn back at me and yell what as I was trying to get his attention I only come here to bring guest from out of town to see the view I do warn them and apologize in advance for any bad service or horrible food they may have Stick to and chipsWas given a table and abandoned for Had to flag down a passing waiter to get a glass of water He took our and the food was in a reasonable amount of time Will not come back thoughThe Oasis been a great place to visit and enjoy the We had our rehearsal dinner there ago We won t be going back It been rebuilt from the fire to maximize traffic The food is poor and the staff cannot handle the number of Twice we were to as I can t help you I have all of these other people to take care of It like a tourist trap In short the wait was long the food was poor and the service was too thin Very poor experience If you value the view at the expense of all that make a decent restaurant this place is for youI just experienced obvious racism If I could give this establishment zero I would After the best experience in zip lining my and I to take in a nice view and eat The young man who us was nice and told us the wait to sit by the water was about We patiently and when the waitress came to get us she sat us outside in the very back The were cut open cushion was hanging out and very nasty There were several tables at the front closer to the water The waitress was very rude and those are people on the list Mind you we were on the list to be seated I was confused I Is there is a special list Her response was the list is in order As I sat for about I felt very uncomfortable and poorly Especially when I who were added to the list after us were seated at the nice tables closer to the water I went to the front desk and told the waitress that the table was nasty and were cut open because this was true At this point I just a nice table and clean The waitress came outside and said what do you want me to to do She to drag from another table that were her and away I sat is utter disgust We were the only in the restaurant and I felt like we were being hidden at the back I don t think anyone should be this way I decided they did not deserve our money and politely left It t even worth my time or energy May God bless themRude unhappy waitress Food out of So many empty tables yet there was a min wait Food t come out w all ordered and waitress on them rather than taking them off the bill She said since some of the I ordered came out she would still have to charge me for the that t I the tip in the previous bill left on the table was Now I know why Table next to us got up left waitress never came over Also so many other bad I think the head should get fired and all staff Such a shame for a beautiful venueI would give for this place for their food and Check the pic we were and a the server us with so that she can add gratuity Worst way to earn moneyUnfortunately we t give them of a star What not been said about the horrible food The food at the Oasis is below what you could get at Cabana or Bell and we re not even of Cabana and Bell I know people give it for the view but come on How could you give a rating of for Nature when that would be there regardless The food is horrible the service and the are watered down We went on a and the wait was very long First you have to find parking The parking lot is times the size it used to be but there still was nothing available After fighting everyone else to find parking you have to stand outside in a line like you re at a theme park for Then you get a pager and are told that your wait would be about hour Since the wait was long we went up to the bar It was and it took us about to get a drink We ordered the house margarita and we later found out that we were their Perfect Margarita which is For an drink it was horrible light on the alcohol and watered down I wish I could give them the excuse that it had been sitting at the bar for a while but we ordered it at the bar We were finally seated an hour and a half later so the total wait was waiting in line and then the hour and a half wait The place is designed for the view so we did have a table with a great view The view is never anyone s complaint about the Oasis When we saw the menu we that we were not the standard house margarita for at the bar and our server for house It took a good to get our and like the first these were not great so we t think anything of it We ordered the and fish While our order we for chips and and were snobbishly told that they are not complimentary and that they would charge us We said You can keep your chips and so What good old fashioned restaurant for chips and I have never been to any or restaurant for that matter that for chips and We got our food about later and thought it was horrible The pork in the was the highlight of the whole meal It was tasty however the tortilla was soggy squishy dripping and soaked with mango liquid It was so runny that it ran between your and made the bottom tortilla into dough and tasted like crap How can you screw up a Seriously The fish Where was the fish For the fish that you could find in your it was dry rubbery and flavorless The rice was an ball of mush with some type of seasoning The black came straight out of the Hill Country Fare from When we got the bill we that we were each for the again We out waitress why we were for the Perfect Margarita She told us that the regular are watered down horrible and they never recommend or serve them to their So basically they take it upon themselves to upgrade your because they know their own suck This was not our first time here but it will be our last We refuse to go back EVER No matter how many new or family comes to visit from out of state visit happy hour th of end of Summer someone begging us to go you get the hint we re not Someone said in a prior review which I wish I had read before going on a whim that the only thing you can do is go and enjoy a few I don t think its even worth it to go there for that because as I stated above the tasted like flavored water The only way it might be worth it is if you drink a few or eat and drink before you get there or somewhere else and plan on standing around people watching Service food suck not much else to add to our reviewoasis i have lived here a very long time and i have always the from your but i have never your food maybe if i could splurge and spend on an entree but since your small t good and your like it s either from a jar or made from canned i m not risk wasting on a meal i just order the and corn tasty sadly i can t order a margarita here either yuck yuck yuck i ordered one on the and you d think sitting over lake travis at the sunset of a margarita would be stellar nope i even tried two different the next would be better nope where is your bartender they need to take some classes props to the waiter for being cool enough to give me the option to try another drink when i t like the first one and for not us intoHere now and service totally to get a drink This is ridiculous and such a shame Beautiful but Horrific service Don t come here if your hungry or thirstHow can you go wrong with I still don t get it We ordered their and the meat was chewy and plain awful Their and view though are good but not sure if it is worth going backSo for a large group of I was we t have to wait long for our table That and the view were probably the only good thing about this visit We had to wait over and for our food and then it was cold and not even that great Will not be coming back to this place ever againREAD THIS BEFORE YOU GO HERE My wife and I Yelp everything before we go We love to go out and eat and we like a nice place to go I understand that every place bad and good The Oasis on Lake Travis horrible for being on Yelp and it is true if you read other people talk about the great view but the bad food horrible food its been to other in with great We have been here before and it is fun with a group of people or just a couple but the service is terrible I am writing this review because I just got back form this place with an empty stomach My group and I ordered our and an appetizer The waitress brought out our and we never saw her again We sat for an hour enjoying the great view and never saw our server or food our were empty and we t even get our check so we just got up and went inside and for a manager Once I spoke to the manager he at my check then he my I never even got it I said that I don t believe I should pay for the because we more and we never saw our food or server Then he said you drank the alcohol t you and my wife and I only had one each He was rude and it was horrible customer service because he had a bad attitude about the whole situation while I was cool about it Bottom line is the food is id rather eat at Bell the service and the management bad customer service They lost our service and I would give it if I could Don t go here if u want to have good food and service It is a waste of your moneyWent here for late lunch early dinner on my birthday wanting to eat somewhere with a nice view We to be seated outside and we got a table directly in the sun with no umbrella which t too bad when I sat with my back to the sun but then I t see the view We got our and ordered some and a beer Rita to start I was looking at my water when I tiny little were literally down on us They brought out the and before they could set it down we if we could have a different table because of the bug storm and they said they would go ask and still the on the table Then they came out with my beer Rita and if we had to be and put down my drink so they could go find out where we could be to Then a manager looking man came up to our table to ask if we had to be and said he would find a new table for us At this point I was because we to be before we got our food so we t have landing in our food and they still our and my drink down at the table where it was Our was cold and had on it by the time we got to our new table so we had to scrape off the top layer and my beer Rita also had a few that had fallen in to it other than the I was also disappointed in both the quality and quantity for it being Once we got settled inside we ordered the plate it came out surprisingly fast The taste was very mediocre The service was good Our waitress checked on us many times and was very friendly Update off a star because the food upset my stomach No funThis restaurant is utterly disappointing The view of Lake Travis however IS beautiful Our service was close to terrible It took to get extra tortilla chips after and blanca Our water took forever as well We stayed here longer than we not because of anything other than our extremely slow and lackluster service The are crowded and you feel as if everyone is listening to your conversation Our food selection was and shrimp chicken The are supposed to be covered in a sauce This sauce Tasted exactly like sauce It nothing from the ocean To replace rice and on the enchilada meal with cost an extra The only thing good about this establishment is it s food which I rate right above averageover an hour for our order on a afternoon before leaving Waiter had no idea how much longer the food would even take Great mediocre food and horrible service Also spoke to the manager who t even seem to careSo I if I could order fruit as an entree and our server said yes When the food came I was given a little bowl with mostly honeydew and some cantaloupe and sprinkled in When we a server Drake if there was anything bigger he said he would go get something He tried his best to get me something bigger better but when he for help from another server Sam he told him that there was absolutely nothing bigger and I d just have to deal with that So I for another side of fruit Additionally they ran out of lemonade so Sam gave us warm canned lemonade instead and when my he told them that it was free anyway and it s the same as it is from the machine Then ended up charging us for it The server Drake who was not even assigned to our table was more helpful than anyone else The sunset was very nice but I t come here againThe only star is for the view I thought this place was so charming last summer I the market place on the sculpture I was so disappointed to bring this summer to find a huge ugly gray parking garage and construction apparently going on right on top of it I guess the owner t think he enough money As everyone else the food is awful the menu is so limited and the drink outrageous But you are paying for the view I hate that they have the tables on the patio especially on the edge so close together you could reach over and grab a cold limp fry off the plate of the guy next door No one in my party their food and my and were with no ketchup and my waiter did not show up so I could ask for some until later I just did without Our were empty our long gone No I don t think we be going back there are plenty of other to goTotal menu change and it like they every local what they and then that list in the trash and went to the extreme opposite like even the is about below Come for the view just don t order the food Eat before you ever get here and then have a beer preferably before the sun goes down and all the nosey cell phone picture come out and crowd your table so you can t the one thing you came for If you want or need the experience go someplace else If you want traffic slow service mediocre and ride then this is your placeI just gave one star so I could write a review the view is very nice but the food is horribleA tourist thing I only go when people are in town food and menu Not a fan I live right by there so it s sad I can t go more often but my palette and pocketbook say noThe Oasis on for my party lunch and I t be disappointed The only pro for this company is their location For that you can just go visit Lake Travis and save money Their location is also probably why everything on their menu is ridiculously I t mind paying a higher price if their food was actually tolerable I order the thinking to myself well at least either one of the chicken or will taste good right WRONG My chicken was bland no flavor or nothing and my very and did not have any flavor either Everybody in our party ordered something different and nobody their plate or any positive Their chips are store bought chips used for you typically buy in school not even tortilla chips Of course their is store bought too like Unfortunately my Matron of Honor got food poisoning from the plate she ordered She was constantly to go to due to the frequency of feeling ill She even burst an eye vessel due to vomiting so frequently It was definitely the meat because she very ill right after eating there to the point where she was unable to go with us out that night to celebrate I would give The Oasis ZERO and am everyone i know to stay away They really need to get new management and start all over if they want to continue to stay in business Oh and staff is very rude Get some customer service trainingI too feel to write something after my last experience As an I have gone to Oasis so many times for as long as I can remember When I was little I used to look forward to it and as I got older I definitely the view more As everyone and as I always you do NOT go here for the food You go for and chips with The view is the ONLY thing the place going for it I always take people who visit here for the amazing view but this last time over Thanksgiving weekend I was completely turned off For sure it expanded and I was confused There s a giant garage and now this complex with these different Not sure if I that much t feel very y that aside the service was ATROCIOUS We had the WORST and most RUDE server we ever had I think her name was Zero or something it was sunny and my are weak but she had such an attitude Yes we had a large group but all we is if we can put two tables together as they had put us on this weird long bench She kept saying It s not really up to me I ask It t until later we finally got to move and this was after her attitude and after that we barely saw her I was just so turned off from the experience I would rather go to Hula Hut or better yet anywhere else than come here again The large plastic t as nostalgic for me this time around I foresee this place becoming one thing a large tourist trapWorst in Their mix like a used urinal cake Learn how to use a limenever again Went for a birthday dinner t end up eating but had a taste of the what The drink was good The view was nice but I m sure you can go many free for a view The drive I pass next timeTerrible service the bartender for chips he said he had some but was too busy to give us any Incredibly long bad service can t comment on food as we gave up on our min wait and left without eating The were weak but priced fairVisiting from this restaurant only one positive thing going for itself the Other than that everything is below anyone s The the dirty rug inside the restaurant the staff and their service We for a table After waiting we another to get a server We down two since we were unable to get to the and notified them that we have been waiting and no one come to see us Few pass by and our server finally came Her excuse was i t know i was covering this table Um so had we not down anyone we would be waiting until eternity to actually get a server because clearly communication t exist in this place My family were the one who to give this place another shot but after their visit to this restaurant I m sure they won t be coming back nor will they ever bring any from outside of p s The food is mediocre Mediocre just went to Bell convinced the only reason why people go here is because of the view Save your money and the headache This is I m sure theres plenty of delicious that provide great service Update I m going to try my best and be fair Our server after we finally got one really tried her best to meet our needs She checked up on our table frequently and if we anything else I can appreciate that However everything else prior to that was just a mood killerThis place needs to be featured on Kitchen It really is that bad If you feel like paying for Bell quality food then this is your place That s right We re talking cheese on the Our waitress who pretty much completely us we get a side of which she later us for That s right for a side of The are good and the view is wonderful Clearly the management this and chosen to make absolutely no effort on any other front service food quality They are on the view and will continue to treat as the who are too stupid to know better Come here for the view get a few laugh at the Carnival Cruise ship style conga line of drunk ers upstairs dancing to s and then leave ProntoSure the view is lovely and people mostly come here to drink but charging for of limp lettuce I t come backWatered down Terrible service Bad food Tacky One hour wait to get a table plus another wait to get seated People come for the amazing but it t excuse the bad experience This place needs a competitor so they can step it upThis was the worst food I ever had in It took about to get our The were dry and cold The are spectacular but that also meant that we had a crowd of people pushing past our table to take Beware the crap food and poor serviceNot only is the food over priced it is ABSOLUTELY horrible I had company come in from out of town and to take them somewhere special this was not the place I ordered for my meal and had to ask for a side of because they to have forgotten that ingredient when them My guest ordered the tortilla soup which was more like a thick tomato mess gave that one back to the kitchen The local beer selection included Shiner Really That s it No or any other of the many fine local I can understand paying for the view but t they at the very least attempt a decent plate Oasis you are really missing an opportunity to be a great place But for me I will not be back to find out if you ever embrace that opportunity Such a disappointmentNice but that is about it Unfortunately I never got to try the food Service was so horrible I never saw a waiter while sitting for Finally gave up and leftBEFORE I lived in The Oasis was a must do on each visit Now I only live a few away and have no desire to go The Oasis used to be so cool The sunset capital of was very fitting Even though the food was and the were expensive both still true sitting on one of the many small off Lake Travis made it all worth it THEN there was the fire in A lot of made during the rebuild however it still had great charm with its dolphin huge outdoor wooden deck with stage and great seating NOW the owner turned it into a disgustingly egregious over the top touristy piece of rubbish He and a partner tried to expand even further by building and leasing other retail and HUGE FAILURE are closed and with the exception of a jerky shop and a small winery all of the retail are empty Ghost town Some may attribute the demise to the drought that poor Lake Travis is currently suffering however the downfall well before the Lake to disappear Tip Go to the Iguana Grill just a short drive down The a little better the are a little less expensive and you still get that great view without all the and rudeI was really excited about this place unfortunately I t read the before coming I would have never trying it with all the terrible First off let me start by saying we with a group of at on May th and we were not sat until after We were told and continued to be told another Thank goodness one of my was bold enough to stay down by the hostess until we were seated If not I don t think they would have ever sat us Second once we finally sat down we immediately ordered and food because by we were all Part of the food showing up before we even got our and before one girl even got iced tea Then to make up for it they brought which nobody even at our table ordered a WHY One of the in our party had enough and to pay for her margarita which I don t blame her she was halfway through dinner before they brought it to the table No apology no manager to the table nothing They knew with in our party they were a tip so why bother Third half of our table ordered shrimp They were so spicy they could barely even eat them I absolutely love spicy and even I t choke it down LAST and FINAL STRAW and why I will be in call directly to the owner manager on duty everyone that ordered the shrimp from food poisoning All of the were throwing up and had diarrhea all night Some of these people had to get on the next day they could barely walk from dizziness because they were so from throwing up everything Its just a shame that location is unreal but honestly if I could write a review every day to eliminate people from coming here I would TERRIBLE TERRIBLE everythingYou pay for the view The food is close to terrible We ordered a chicken that was so dry with artificial tasting cheese on The tasted like dirty fish the was dry as well Service was slow the food came out Luke warm at bestWe don t even buy food here any more Just The food is not worth it The view is terrific and sure is worth a visit with from out of town But don t let your order food The service is also poor don t visit often enough and from what I they don t do a good job their tables or supporting theirView is great but that s about the only positive thing I can say about the place Food and service to be some of the worst in all of I been to my share of tourist traps over the that usually high and service but this place t even try I believe they share a laugh each night after the place as the they count the money At least try Oasis you re in a cool city and have a great locationI was told by several people that the view here is great but that the food is not good I thought the food would be just average but it was worse than average I had a chicken salad and the combination of was awful They it with some odd orange sherbet cream cheese scoop which was way too sweet The dressing was cloying and the chicken was tough This is definitely a touristy spot with bad food so I do not recommendI been here several times and always enjoy the but this was the first time I ordered their food in the starlight It was terrible with a side of atrocious for the price It was as almost as if they went out of their way to make it bad I ordered the fish which I don t even understand how anyone could screw it up but it was beyond bland It cost over and it t come with avocado which I think should been a given To get it on the side would cost It was only swallowable because someone else at our table ordered and t finish it so I my with it to make it better I guess they figure their view up for the supremely scrappy food and in a way it does I just don t think that good food is really that Why don t they both My son did like his chicken sandwich however It was bad enough that I made it a point to take the time and effort to get on here and post thisMy wife and I went to see Suade play at the Oasis last night Suade is a great band and the Oasis always been of fun When we got to the Oasis at it took us min to get our drink It was absurd to have one bartender serving beer and only two serving mixed for the entire Starlight Lounge It was terribly to wait in line while one bartender us and the other was to the wait staff I have lived in for the last and always and family visit the Oasis However it the Oasis and it s owner lost focus on providing a unique place to have a great time The Oasis now like a tourist attraction I do not plan to go back or suggest any of my family or go their eitherThis was not worth the money Terrible service food My chicken was over The service was so bad they turned on the with water and it took until it stopped Felt sorry for a couple next to us b c she was so wet that water was dripping from her Our waiter never our table or if we were I m rating it was one star for the beautiful view That is all is worth going to this restaurantThey don t take but the view is always worth the wait Supporting locally is important and because the Oasis to so many of our local I always feel good thereThey are very unorganized and not the crew Host staff is extremely horrible Sent us back and forth sat people before us that just up who first available just like us I gave a one star because the view is beautifulThe food is substandard and the service even worst than the food The place with out the view would have closed by nowThe food was terrible Apparently the staff is used to because they don t even try to fix the problem Management apparently t care because nobody even came to ask or apologize when the meal was sent back The view t that nice to warrant a trip there HorribleOverall bad experience The only good thing was the over an hour and politely the hostess how much longer in which she with an attitude After we got seated and nobody ever came by to help us We ended up just leaving Only go for and the view otherwise you be disappointedI t been here in Good to know I was missing nothing we ordered as an appetizer and were to see them after we had our Each dish brought out individually so our son was done before we got ours It s a night with few in the restaurant and plenty of staff and still had terrible service Had to get up to ask the bartender for ketchup they know they have an amazing location for them lake They won t get better No reason to The food tasted like it fell off a Cisco truck Oh well In ten I try again Or notYes yes yes the view is spectacular But the food is TERRIBLE and I can t even think of an adverb strong enough to appropriately describe how bad the service is at this place We had that The Oasis had management brought in a new chef the menu and turned around and so we were willing to give it another shot Big mistake I m never giving this place another try If you want great food service and a sunset view of Lake Travis do yourself a favor and go to RanchThis place grown into the size of an amusement park Good luck finding the The food is terrible and the are weak and expensive The only thing positive is the view I had so many people tell me the same thing about this place and I agree I wish they would revamp and live up the the spectacularFor a restaurant on the lake experience it s not worth the price of the food or lack of service I higher for a restaurant on the lake Being my first time in and here I would not recommend this place to anyone The waiter was not happy and was visibly kind of rude and he forgot a plate thus making us wait to eat until the other person for their plate and making our food cold I m sad because I more from this awesome lakeside restaurantYes if there was less than star that s how I would rate the food at the Oasis lake Travis There was of us in the group we all got sick The wait staff took forever and the food took forever by the time we got all our food it was really cold I strongly recommend not to eat at this place I definitely the health department the next day and hope they go check up on themWill absolutely NEVER come back again first it took two Two for our food then they up the and one guy told us he was a manager and said he d discount the ticket Yet again it was wrong so the other manager comes and us nope he was wrong sorry And accused of us the line like what in the hell Then the icing on the cake told the to follow us out We the why they were following us and they said because the thought we were hostile Yet each time we got with our waiter about something we assured him it was not his fault and he almost crying and said you should know how i feel I m dealing with this too We all on tipping him well because we felt bad for him but we all left because of what the management did And as we out they said over the they re walking out now Place is a joke both tables around us as well And this is the third time I been and gotten horrid service DO NOT GO HERE unless you plan on waiting for food or General service for about And get from the management like the now higher so we re and don t have any people BUT YOU DID GOOD IT WAS YOUR FAULT WILL NOT RETURN IN FACT PONDERING TALKING TO MY ATTORNEY ABOUT THE BY MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO THE POLICE THIS IS A NORMAL HERE STAY AWAYHad been very excited to visit but hugely disappointed The view was great After waiting was seated in a completely dark corner outside It was only after our server next tables which was with the light on did they switch on some We never got the chips which are in the beginning Never got the wine menu which we The order was wrong The it the chicken patty was just Chicken had no flavor My daughter white milk and ketchup with the meal Never got it The bacon wrapped chicken appetizer was the saving grace I would only go for the view and maybe order some but never the foodHaven t been here in almost The parking and have been built up so it s a nice place to walk around but the food at The Oasis is not very good at all out of a can taste on the the lettuce though I recommend going there for a few chips and and the view of a great sunset Skip the foodPlease avoid The tortilla chips were stale the had no taste The service slow The only decent thing is the view was niceThe Oasis was disappointing I to take my mother to their Day brunch they were hosting on May th I am from out of town and my mother was very excited to eat here and show this place off I checked out the brunch and it said that were for the brunch so I and to make a reservation but the said not to worry that are not Confused I back again the next day and tried to make the Mother s Day reservation the second told me it was on a first come first basis I also my husband to call and see if he could figure out what the heck was going on with brunch at this place Anyway Mother s Day comes and we drive up to the oasis after church We at am and we are told that yes are and we did not have one even though we had been trying all week to get a straight honest answer from anyone about this damn brunch So we put our in and for a table and decided to eat off the lunch menu because we were already there I had a with skimp seriously could get a from any fast food joint The view of the lake was nice This place is just but what really me off was how the management completely disinterested with our situation And how mislead I was that entire week trying to make the damn brunch reservation management said it had been sold out since night Then why not just tell me that in one of the phone I made to you Oasis It could have been so easy to go anywhere else and have a nice brunch Anyway mediocre food at best Sloppy unorganized management nice viewBeautiful venue terrible food and terrible service When we got there the hostess us if we to go to the newly open third floor with beautiful but she nor the waiter told us that it had a severely limited menu to the rest of the restaurant The service was also slow and you had to fill up your water by yourself at the cooler I ended up because the other were too sad but the were depressing The t and the chicken was warm The Oasis never been known for their food but everything but the water level been in decline the past fewThe food is and garbage Save your money Yeah the view is outstanding so if you really want to pay the price for the view I guess go ahead Personally I thing that the brewhouse next door better food but it s still mediocre For the that they want I would just stick to The service is a hit or miss but you always get food here Stick to the or just save your moneyWow first time here and what a disappointment Terrible service stood in line for the bar first time was min and the second was From the minute we in the staff was rude and it t get any better until we got our waiter he was great We ended up leaving because we had someone with us that was intoxicated but still not a disturbance to anyone We kept over hearing them talking about kicking her out Very unprofessional been they were snickering about the drunk at our table Needless to say after that we left No food but I hear it is mediocre at best First and last time I visit this place and pay for a corona Suck it Oasis I will spend my money elsewhere Oh and beautiful view that s all they haveWent for a brunch a few back and Food is absolutely the worst vodka for bloody mary and no This place is just the most over rated place in It such potential if they could just cook decent food And please dump the s dining furniture Eh but why bother Go walk around Don t eat This place is begging for a slap downThe food is average and the staff and management need more training on customer service The view is beautiful but next time i will take on the observation deck then go eat somewhere elseIf you want to go to this restaurant to drink a margarita at the bar and watch the sunset from behind and of tables be my guest I however was to enjoy a meal with my father We got to the restaurant around in line to get onto the hostess list for about and was told it would be a two hour wait We through the gift shop and went to the bar and sat down at a small bar top table We ordered a margarita a diet coke two and a The bartender quickly gave us our and put in a request for from the kitchen About later we where our was we were given and apology by a server and brought chips and About later there was still no sign of more than tables in immediate sight and the buzzer still t gone off As we up to return the buzzer it went off and we told the hostess what had We got sad and an I m so sorry as we left the restaurant at Long story short We t even get at the bar Don t waste your time with this restaurant if you don t have the patience of SaintSo I haven t been here since in and now I know why The service is terrible I m with the wait to be sat but the wait for a waiter waitress was horrible Took before anyone came to the table when he did finally show up we ordered everything right away Food was great but the staff It should not take to have a simple and or a meal I will not be and and don t recommend anyone coming here In the old days it was a great place to come but now it s to commercial So sadservice i have ever had My sister went up to the bar and the bartender told her he had other stuff to do and to basically go screw yourself and t even look at her Yet the next person who did the same he He made the comment ever and we travel all year That a lot I highly do NOT recommend this place unless you want the staff to treat you like you re a big piece of crap I will make sure to tell everyone to stay away from this place So sad it a nice view with service worse than any other place I ever been to We were so upset and no one that their staff gave such bad and rude service They don t even give that bad of a service in L A or the ghetto in any city or country we have ever traveledMy The Oasis as a total tourist trap This the Our check came to before tip for the four of us We ordered chips with and and enchilada platter along with soft domestic beer and margarita a very small one maybe We then ordered berry for a dessert A sundae here one scoop of ice cream with a berry sauce whip cream and chocolate sticks Nothing in our meal quality Everything was low end The sunset was lovely There was even a plane buzzing the place at sunset We that I got a laugh when one of our party said it must have been the owner showing off his private plane and out all the paying for it Here is my tip to you go ANYWHERE else to eat and then come here for a drink and the sunsetIt me of a super trashy cruise ship so if you like that obviously don t go anywhere trashy and awful food this is your place The service was lame the food is not only awful but incredibly over priced the outdated furniture all the view less than spectacular I have lived in a long time and after going to the Oasis a second time by request of a friend I know I will not go back again nor would I recommend ityour drive your money and your time are best spent on the sunset What can I say the food and service is But what s killing me is that there are numerous bad and the establishment to not give a rat s ass about it The food is quite for what you get We made the trek from San and I m that we even for the food To start the was INCREDIBLY bland and no two bowls tasted the same When we mention this our waitress it off She then to ignore our table for the next It t even worth our time to tell a manager as previous are pretty clear that they don t care The were Nothing special which is a shame because the view is really something In short if you re going to spend your money here don t give them more than what s necessary Its not worth itView was good Food was mediocre at best for food that I could have gotten for cheap at another restaurant Pretty much for a view Waiter tried to hurry up the manager and chef for our food We an hour to get our food for view and for the service and food We should have gotten our food for freeI went here looking for the food that they to have and I was disappointed to see only menu that were chicken and cheese And really the only they can come up with are My daughter ordered from the appetizer section of the menu and they came with melted on top not the creamy that is normally on It s like they sprinkled cheese on top of tortilla chips and stuck them in the microwave The chips were hard and dry and the melted cheese was greasy on top of the chips Totally NOT worth the they I ordered the chicken wrap and t at all I ate half the wrap and left the rest Husband had the chicken salad stuffed avocado and he said it was but he was in the mood for and had to settle for the avocado I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone who s looking for good food There is an amazing view of Lake Travis from the back of the restaurant so go for to see the view but I would not suggest eating hereHORRIBLE We went to this place a lot from other people but it turned out to be the WORST RESTAURANT experience ever we went there around in the evening to experience the dining experience with the famous sunset while we were waiting one of their came and told us they have just this new restaurant right next door with live music and there won t be any wait time so we decided to go for it But we were in for the shock of our life that restaurant had first come first serve policy where we had to find our own table now of course it was almost sunset time and nobody to leave their tables till after so we were literally musical chair with other like us and people were literally standing by the tables waiting for those people to leave Honestly this was the worst marketing and customer service we had ever experienced run around on the busy weekend evening to fend for a table without anybody or helping or So we finally got tables for our group of after a lot of chasing around and the lady waiting for the next table sat down on our table saying she is old and she will get up once the people on the other table left so till then what do we do We hear racial from other directed towards us amidst the loud live music Finally we all got seated We the server if we could join the tables but the manager flat out to let us do that We for our table to be yes it still had the left over from previous The server one table and we had to keep calling them to clean the other one then the long wait for the menu and complimentary chips and we had to literally get up and go look for the manager to get he said he is taking care of it but still since we were seated and that too after them know that the were very hungry nobody up we around and the people who had come after us had already getting their food and we were completely finally one of us went looking for a manager again and found his boss who said he was going to expedite our order due to the delay we gave our order but again had to keep till they brought the expedited order later Bottom line STAY AWAY FROM THISBeautiful scenery Now the rest is bad The blonde bartender on the floor was grumpy and had zero customer service Took over an hour to take our order Took about that long to get the food I to order anything The one bill for the entire party is total crap That is how they trap into hereA group of us went for dinner about of us It was everyone s first time and we knew the wait for a table would be long an hour and a half but we had no idea how long the food would take We were sat down and our waitress was not a happy camper we ordered our food and then And And And It was about a two hour wait for our food The worst part is about an hour and a half way into waiting and new table was sat down next to us and they got their food in When we got our food we for the manager When he came out he t even look at us he at the floor and off some speech and how they got their You re The Oasis You get your butt every night You should have this stuff down I lived in my entire life and I been told you just go for the view That the food and service They were right and I never should have gone First time at The Oasis last time at The OasisImagine a PRIME piece of real estate and setting up a restaurant with spectacular with MEDIOCRE food That is the Oasis Imagine the revenue possibility if you good food like a no brainer to me The food was absolutely horrible We had shrimp and beef nasty rice and disgusting Most of the food in our party did not get eaten The fried shrimp platter with was greasy and were just as greasy If looking for quality food this the place nor is it worth itIf I could give zero I would This place is a tourist trap It s the food is AWFUL and the are AWFUL My fish and tasted like rubber the margarita was gross and had no flavor The only nice thing is you get to see the sunset over the lake but find another way to watch the sunset this place is not worth it Plus you have to wait an average of to get a table Honestly I m not sure how this place stays openThe wait staff was either inexperienced or did not want to be there because the service was almost non existent The food was brought out cold and was similar in quality to a low end cafeteria Therefore the low value for the relatively high cost would definitely keep me from to The Oasis on Lake TravisSadly the view is all this place going for it The wait is horrendous the food mediocre at best and the service from inexperience and MuchI give it a one star only the view was and the chips and the were the best part of the ENTIRE MEAL The were horribly made the wait was way to long for the amount of empty tables the place had The food is so bad it no flavor and old and up it was like a bad episode of Kitchen This place amazing potential and it s sad to see it go to waste There was no music no no nothing it s and they close at and we felt like the place had closed already I ordered the fish which completely fell apart once I picked up my soggy tortilla the fish tasted old and the rice was a soggy consistency My had the combination plate which he had to pour a copious amount of to get it remotely right We drove all the way from for this and are leaving completely disappointed and with a slight stomach acheawful place poorly run but beautiful place for by extremely horrible food are in from local nice marketing so the geriatric black sock wearing don t know that the food is terrible and highly they just know that they are now stuck there until the next bus leaves I recommend a truck up the road and to the lake insteadI been up to this area or times and was always curious about the restaurant so we went to The Oasis the other day it was really disappointing I never seen a waiter be so confidently and outwardly by his The food is bar food nothing special They grossly overcharge due to their location I never go back to this restaurantThe service was not prompt We put our name in and their computer system and t call us We longer than we should have and even why we were waiting so long Their manager was not accommodating after waiting for a table and our food came out cold The view is amazing but the food and experience t worth the troubleI wish there were a star Bad service food is expensive taste is just not much However the lake and the view are so beautiful Feed yourself a good dinner and come here for the view onlyI the Oasis once quite a number of back and had no lasting good or bad so I was happy to return with out of town family when they expressed interest in going This place is an absolute embarrassment to I can get the view in plenty of other and not put up with zero hospitality poor service severe lack of cleanliness throughout and atrocious food all leaving no doubt that they Oasis owner management could not care less about salvaging any semblance of pride and it will be my last time to grace them with my presence Starting at front door did not greet of them around hostess area chatting but had to be by us regarding a table even though there were no other waiting to be seated It was so they to be more concerned regarding why are people still coming and we re not getting to go home early Yes we actually them this Great job Oasis management on customer service in the that make the first impression on your Once seated the service was slow and extremely sub par throughout Not a smile to be seen and we to be as much an inconvenience to our waiter as we were to the Guess there s not a lot of motivation to provide quality when you have the gratuity locked in before the are even seated unless quality is a part of the culture of the restaurant That s t appear to be in the vocabulary at the Oasis I always tip and have zero issue with giving a super tip beyond this amount but it ought to be not That s what most of us have to do work for and EARN our pay not through because we know it s already coming our way At this point there t much doubt where this was heading and yes the lack of quality carried over to the food Absolutely the worst beef I ever had like they came out of a banquet frozen dinner with some garbage rice concoction on the side and straight out of the can Zero seasoning on any of it Tasteless garbage Can t leave off the trip to the men s room like it about once a week at best and in severe need of an update to the Very nasty and disgusting I be back to s as fast as possible to get the anti Oasis treatment and food that always leaves me with a smile and if I can t make it to s I swing into Bell where they can match the quality of the Oasis for about th the price For any visiting our great city please do yourself a favor and skip the Oasis We would like you to return home with the right impression of There are plenty of quality to spend your money on great food and if you re looking for the view of for that tooIf I could give zero I would My husband stood at the hostess stand for min while I went to the bathroom not one of the or what I think was a said a word What took me so long only were in working order Taking us to the table it was dirty glass to be With the amount of people standing around the place should look a lot better Great view but they stuck us in the sun by a family with a ton of and there were many other tables open in the shade Water tasted like it came straight from the lake Go if you just want to ONLY WANT TO TAKE A PICTUREHoly unicorn this is garbage food I dont even know where to begin Tried the whole menu with a large party not get detailed than Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for food Do not come here for foodWell I tried one last time Once again my order was screwed up the food was inedible the watery were horribly over priced and the management t give a s t Never again NEVER Plus during the summer when The Brew I tried a couple more times but they are an arrogant mediocre band who think they are really too good for The whole Oasis experience was a bad one No more I haven t been back since and even if I have from out of town who want to go see the sunset I won t go I will take them to The Iguana Grill It s not great but far far better than The Oasis Never EVER againWe went on a evening They told us to be seated it took No one took our order for for over From the time we ordered our food until it was brought to us took over an hour And the food was cold for a table of with completely cold food Could not find the waitress to complain our bill and left We are never coming backBad service Waiter never gave us any on our gave in the last minute priced food The view in the place is the only upBeautiful view Horrible service Terrible food Just for touristIf Yelp star I take it It is very disappointed the server attitude as I stand in the host place to wait go and pick up the silverware but no one want to take us After that one server come and bring me the corner table without umbrella it is super hot and after I seat The server left without coming back st time in town and really want to come here to check out but it like they are so busy and do not need more customer If you want the nice service and good place I AM VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND DO NOT COME IN HERE TO TAKE YOUR DINER if you need a here is the good place to comeGood view entertainment food Bad service wait time It took to receive of beer ordered from our waitress came out with NO chips Got chips later on my own Dinner came out with NO silverware NO NO ketchup If you have a lot of time and don t care about service go to the OasisI m really disappointed that I m writing this review I really to love The Oasis but the food and were truly unacceptable For the used for the were atrocious The cold raw flour t fully whatsoever I was unaware that when you ask for your check they provide you with a partial check and then take it upon to charge your card for an amount you are unaware of This is very unsettling because we specifically told our server to split our bill At the time our check said so we told the server we would each be paying each My friend was paying her half in cash and I was paying my half with my bank card Well when our server returned he handed me a receipt with a charge on my card He didnt say a word he must have thought I t going to notice So the manager comes to the table and that the check he gave us was a partial check Wait what So our total was really but even so WHY T I NOTIFIED BEFORE HE UNLAWFULLY RAN MY CARD FOR AN AMOUNT I T AUTHORIZE He could have came back to the table and told us the actual total so my friend and I could have split it evenly from there The manager incredibly and said there really t anything she could do She also stated that if she voided it I most likely t get my money for another week so I would basically have a double charge on my card What the f Anyone thinking of going please remember Don t order the and make sure they provide you with the TOTAL check amountfor with the family just to be seated next to the band where we t hear each other only on a plastic table for They us due to but was still horrible I the waiter if it was their bar menu to which he no normal menu He was rude we left without We did spend our time at the Oasis Brewery where service was great and menu was better even it better I assumed the food at the Oasis with would be better guess not Next time if I go this way I will go straight to the tap room order food without waiting and enjoy just as goodstar is not even worth it to give to this place They are advertising for the sunset capital The place was beautiful but they place us facing the post on near the also the table was wobbly I told the server on our table that we are not from and we came for the view and can we change our table she that she will come back She never came back Then I the lady on a red shirt which she is one of the hostess and our situation she we don t do that So this that if you are not happy to the table they gave you you have to deal with it This is the first restaurant that I have been to that you cannot request a table transfer That s how I feel Then she said let me see She never returned it was min before I another person and he to understand what I m and the situation he just told us to go and sit on the empty table Then another waitress came by and said the who let us sat on the table and I a guy who I to Then she said that she will find out what s going on She came back and took our The food was awful The was so spicy The sweet potato was a so so I ordered an extra sweet potato and the serving was so small The beef serving for was decent but needs some seasoning or salt Too bland Not worth it I do hope that this place or management do something about it I would not recommend this place to anybodyFood Service is Bad and Slow Will never come back Only nice thing is the viewIf you want to go to a tourist trap then the Oasis is for you The food and service were terrible and it is very obvious that this place is a money making machine and nothing else The are nice but there are other to get the same view without the same awful service and foodI warn you not to eat the food What a waste of money The food taste and like it is all frozen and warmed up in the microwave You can tell by the They are previously frozen Yuck Why would I want to pay for something I can just make myself The view is I only come here for a drink I t recommend anyone to eat hereAmazing view great location Then we tasted the food WOW CATASTROPHIC FAILURE We stopped in on our way to and decided to visit the Oasis as we had great thing about the place We order an appetizer and a beer We t really there to eat just to take in the view and have a quick snack My wife a en appetizer plate For those of you who don t know what this is it s a large plate or even a tray bowl of raw shrimp headless in lime juice You add of cucumber red onion or green serrano yeah it s supposed to be spicy and some add and avocado The shrimp is supposed to be in the lime and you typically eat it as a finger food on tortilla chips or It s a super delicious and refreshing dish when done correctly What we ended up getting was a small plate of shrimp they re NOT supposed to look like they are already and pink in a plate with with some lime juice very watered down some cucumber some red onion and an avocado half with some pico de No joke these shrimp only slightly than the shrimp in a cup of They were definitely not fresh came out of a plastic bag and were prior THEY RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK PINK Was to suggest to a manager they remove it from the menu as their attempt at this dish was dismal and an embarrassment to their menu Beer was cold though and my stepson really his chocolate dessert so wife and I just sat there and on our mediocre plateDecided to go here for dinner our last night in after hearing so much about it Service was very slow We and to place our order Server never came back to see if we anything Finally caught him going by and ask for he brought one There were four of us Food is bland and The view is priceless but that s the high pointReal simple review We already avoid the O because of the mediocre food and somewhat expensive Worth going for a loo at the view and a drink we used to say Last night that Ordered a beer twice over because each time the big chilled glass they brought was literally with dirt on the bottom Once On the second one you would have thought because we just pointed it out that someone would have at least checked the second glass No luck dirty again Clearly they focus on volume rather than simple like clean glasses Not encouragingActual should be MINUS can t do that I be brief because there are many other similar Took to have us seated We thought they must really full NOT The place is and is half empty Took our order and another to be food is mediocre at best WAY I had the shrimp at on the lunch menu You get two lousy which it was frozen cocktail shrimp and rice Well they took so long that they ended up charging dinner on everything So the price to It was pretty much the same with everyone else in our party I could go on and on We management to complain and did not one bit of good HORRIBLE excuse for a restaurant Go there check out the view have a beer or drink if you must and LEAVEThe view is nice but definitely not worth the wait We an hour and min for party of two They were out of Strange I got chicken and the chicken was over tasted like charcoal and the were tough How do you ruin The food tasted worse than fast food Saw a roach crawling on the side of the table across from us Service t that great either I would suggest going through to look and check out the view but eat else whereExperience from last night was awful we around and bought some start light had some music on and we were dancing we finally found a table and sat there the server clean the table and came back by then my party got up to the bar and order some I told the server that we will order the next round with her her reply was you can t seat here if you order at the bar I we will consume or order from you and she if you seat here I m not going to make money I then proceed to tell her I was going to look at the menu and order something She walk away and never came back as of my group they were getting all the from the bar I have been working on the same industry for a long time and I have work there before I will never never talk to a customer like that beforeSo about a year ago or so I came here for my cousin s wedding The food was typical wedding food at best But what drew me in was the Sunset Fast forward to yesterday evening my daughter graduated and I to take her to a nice place to celebrate her accomplishment We were a table of so I understand maybe out take some time But our waiter was slow It took at least to bring our and We ordered several item off the menu and I these Chicken no fire to them whatsoever and a weird after taste old grease maybe bland and flavorless Smoked chicken sauce was unedible and the rice blah Steak just horrible no taste whatsoever After a hefty bill and several for like cheese and this will be my last time here Thanks but no thanks I will spend my money elsewhere The view is not worth the heartburn stomach ache and shock in your bank account you getMy st trip to and I went to Oasis naturally I have to say VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT t taste any alcohol in my cocktail Food Service View was prettyThe one star is for the lake view Dirty silverware and table horrible food fish were inedible due to bad fish lackluster and snail slow service and a minute wait with lots of tables sitting empty whole time and the view would be all we would ever do again Beautiful space location but desperately needs new management and a menu overhaul with a real chefGreat View Food is below average Service is extremely slow bad Review We my and I decided to have dinner here last night I have eaten at the Uncle Billy s at this location I to show my the view We were seated after about a server came for our drink order He also for We ordered the After another or so he brought me my ice tea but he brought my water instead the lemonade she ordered At this time he also if it was that we had ordered This me that he t put our order in It took about another for my to get her lemonade Another out came the chips At this time we our order She ordered a dish and I got the and The was terrible It was more like whiz that you can find at any grocery store or so later came our during this entire the waiter never came to refill The dish was it was terrible The were by a bus boy type of person as he t our server Soon as he left I they t bring me any ketchup for my I about before our server came He t even really come to check on us he up to take the drink order of the table next to us and I just waved to get his attention I him for ketchup and it took forever for him to come back All the while my food is getting cold When he finally did come back I eating and boy was it the food ever Service was so bad slow that I gave a tip That is something that I never do as I have grown up in the restaurant industry For me to leave such a bad tip it s because service was terrible I never base tip on food taste because that s not the server s fault I will never come back here to eat again When I come back to this area again I will try Soleil which is right next doorAwful service great view but been here a handful of times and always bad food and rude service Worth it for the and order because it s for everything else and not goodGo for a drink and to enjoy the view but DO NOT EAT THEIR FOOD I took my here for Mother s Day brunch to see the beautiful view The atmosphere is lovely and we had a great time but that night we both came down with terrible food poisoning that kept us up all night We were both sick and vomiting for over Since I told people this story I have of so many other people who also got sick from the food herePoorly My family of went to the Oasis last night We arrive at about and was told the wait would be We around the complex during that time which to have more shopping for rent than actually rented and ended up to watch the sunset from the balcony of the Oasis neighboring deserted restaurant Soleil After an hour and I had to wait in line again to just speak to the hostess after I got the front of the line I told the hostess we had been waiting for almost two She scrolled and scrolled through her list then said We can seat you now Clearly a mistake on their part one hostess around to deal with of people Ridiculous And the food Dried out salmon and redfish Both were overdone were as good as which is to say bad was a dried out mess Lighting inside was terrible This place was the worst Clearly the only reason to go is to have a few and watch the sunset because the food is very badDon t get the food Everything you read is true Don t even get the coffee or margarita The coffee is just simple plain black coffee with of cream and the margarita is a diluted yellow liquid The chicken tortilla soup t even warm Do go for the sunset phenomenalSo the view is great However after that you get to pay inflated for bad fare server by untrained young wait staff with long Not worth sitting on a deck in degree weatherLiterally the worst restaurant ever eaten at regretfully to find out that all of their food is crap Over priced crapI been here a few times I actually love the location view and of this place however the wait staff is either not well trained or not well In my most recent visit from to reward the associated with my medical company I the staff to meet me at the Oasis All was well we had a great time on the patio except our waitress unhappy to serve us She was a bit older than my mid team maybe early to mid forties Since this was a company reward I decided to treat the team to whatever they and just out since we are so far apart most of the time with our headquarters being in where I currently reside to be much more engaged with her other tables than she was with ours our were left empty for long of time and our table left with dirty while we had our post lunch meeting When I received the check from her I a gratuity was added On the actual receipt it for of or more our party was a party of for all of the time we were there with additional employee showing up after we ate and only glass of water While I do understand that we did sit there for a few enjoying each other and the scenery we were and to be kind throughout the entire visit When I received the bill I intended on tipping her for the time we were her table but as I read the receipt I saw that she had the gratuity on our table of and water only drinker Keep in mind that I also own a restaurant in in addition to the Medical company whose team I was meeting with in I feel as if saw my table of mid and bachelor degree who all make a year as one that would not accommodate her time I went ahead and left her only her gratuity even though normally I would have tipped way more for this type of event like give this place a lower review that it should receive My suggestion would be to not assume anything And to let goI got very little to say about The Oasis Nice atmosphere great view of Lake Travis and decent but and this is a big but the service was awful Honestly the worst Our party would ordered more and food had our server come around more than once an hour and when we decided to leave getting the check was just as I think we should taken advantage of the situation and just without paying and there was no point in to speak with a manager since our server was one Unlike other I also can t give this place extra for the view because there are plenty of other to go to stare at the lake where service is notThe food was absolutely and not tasty and the waiter took a very long time to get to us t check in on us and chips all over my friend and I I would not recommend this place I have not seen the great view everyone about but sitting inside is absolutely the biggest waste of time and money I never tasted a bad house salad until I came hereService Food is over priced You re basically paying for the view Next time I go I will walk in and take some of the sunset and then leave to a better quality restaurantAwful one of the worst restaurant I ever had Terrible food and service to match Upon arrival the waitress according to my receipt said she would need to hold a credit card I told her I t real comfortable with that and that when she brought my bill I preferred to pay with cash than with the card I reluctantly handed over It took to get a frozen margarita that had clearly been melting on the bar while my server was We ordered that came out cold We ordered but they never came After over an hour and the waitress checked in and I told her as much Her response that s weird I our order except for my son s pizza he was hungry and cranky by this point When she brought it out it was cold and just bad half frozen pizza At this point I was more than ready to leave and for my bill When my server brought it she had already run my card without even me look it over and after I had explicitly said I would pay cash Not only that she me for I never ordered I to see a manager Several later a manager came out with a void receipt No apology or anything just a void receipt and a demand for payment I pointed out that the amount on my banking but the amount did not and that I was not going to give him another cent for a meal I never got to eat until I could see a credit He again and came back out a few later to tell me he had taken care of the bill and off Oasis take some pride in yourselves The view t enough to keep everyone coming back Terrible food awful service DON T EVEN BOTHER There are plenty of other around with beautiful tasty food and attentive to waste your time or money going hereGot here at got seated at Got seated at a table on the second floor only to find other tables empty beside us Chips and only got to our table after my sister went to someone to find our waiter After another hour wait we ordered as soon as he got our chips and to the table we come to find the out that the food t even good and is highly expensive for no reason other than the view is amazing You get an overlook of Lake Travis and the nearby on the So to sum this all up if you re willing to pay we had a table for for a nice view then go ahead and come over but your time and money is more worth it at Lupe Tortillawere put out that blocked my view Only had a min window to see the water from my seat before dark Also was by the that also spray water even when the sun went down Go once but dont frequent That whole location is turning into some strange flea market strip center theme parkto give but don t think I could do that The wait is horrible But I thought the food will be wait the worth Even after we got the table the food later And it was just too awful we all t feel like eating after the food came as it was such a long wait The food was bland and nothing special about it I have had much better food The were boiled with no salt or pepper I will never come here again and will not recommend this place to anyone The most place I have seenOur server was a doll The hostess Breezy was full of attitude Even more disturbing was watching toss of dish and mop water over the balcony while we to pay out Is this really Any cleaning in there Environmentally Just Of and your red fish was justView is Everything else is star Bean and cheese which NOWHERE in the description does it state or bacon are not vegetarian And the stupid vegetarian symbol t on vegetarian so I don t think much of it I just assumed that it t have the vegetarian symbol because you had the option of a meat or fish I attached a photo of a salad description that is clearly vegetarian not the vegetarian symbol it a gluten free symbol and the bean and cheese description When I the waitress about the bacon after eating a couple and realizing she was condescending when telling me the were At first I felt dumb but looking back at the menu it does not say She t even try to sound sympathetic She clearly did not care Service was terrible It took to get our first ordered and at first we thought our server was busy but she was only I m charge of tables The view is amazing but you don t have to eat at this restaurant to enjoy theseLet s be clear like in all other the view is TO DIE FOR You re literally paying out the to sit on a deck gorgeous of Lake Travis I came here with a few best and we for our buzzer to go off in the air conditioned bar We were brought to our table by a good looking really friendly host If only HE were the server Our waitress was a young college student but let s be honest most are She brought out immediately and that s where the good service ended She t come back to the table for to take our order Then when she did come back we gave her our drink order and she rushed off before we could order food And let s just get this out of the way the waitress had a table section Another and then she brought out our I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita with sugar on the rim What did I get A strawberry slush margarita with no sugar I t complain because by that point our waitress probably had her head so far up her butt she had no idea what was going on We practically had to maul her to get her to not leave the table so we could order food The food Mediocre at best You can get most of what they serve at a little down the road from your house apartment I m sure and for the price We re talking at least a plate for cheap stuff Then randomly towards the end of our meal another waiter if he can get us anything or if we ordered yet we have food RIGHT IN FRONT OF US He then kept coming by at odd times us the same our actual server had I been a waitress before and I m very familiar with tandem waiting and shift change this was neither and was just odd By the end of it I sworn no more Oasis for food Literally just drink INSIDE THE BAR to avoid a margarita slush and look out theThe ONLY good thing about this restaurant is the view It s become too they have on the upper blasting music the wait to put your name on the wait list was TWENTY Then another TWO to be seatedI don t have an issue with the just so so food I live in and eat it all the time But yes the food is very I had the cheese and they and tasted EXACTLY like from El Patio Whew brought back some bad college budget for me My beef is with the horrible horrible horrible service We chose to celebrate my cousin s graduation at Oasis We ahead since we had and in our party I understand that they don t take no the place was empty when we at p m on Here s a We were seated immediately so far so good We ordered at least six and the four year old ordered a entree from the adult menu Since gratuity is automatic and we had such a large party the waiting on us got pretty well The two year old her water somewhat their fault for not a lid on it ya think Our waiter that it was he was taking our order at the time but t offer to help He also t bring us any extra So we had a pile of wet linen on one table Ten later Grandma her drink Same story as above At this point a pile of was on the table and our food had We had to ASK the idiot to take the wet from grandma s place and bring dry for all of us Food was off to us from one end of the table And when the other end of the table could not hear the the got visibly and around yelling Who ordered the Salad When I am paying a plate my food off is just unacceptable Nobody ever checked on us after the food was brought Good thing we were hungry and t need anything else I m grateful that my uncle us to a nice casual meal but I am so super that he had to fork over quite a bit for non existent servicehostess ever I for a table with better view which was free and available and they move us to their worst table and they behave very rudely afterward The food was very mediocre low quality food The only good point was the view which we t able to enjoy due to sitting in the worst table I suggest you just go for a drink there or not even bother if you like to be as a civilized customerI gone to the Oasis a handful of times over the past so I know the food t that great and you go there to bring out of town to experience the view But the food last night was a joke and I can no longer bring myself to take or family there The management should be embarrassed by what they serve for the amount of money they charge I would have better fish in a school cafeteria than what I had last night The fish had no taste the slaw was nothing more than of raw cabbage and a few all topped with a nasty sauce that tried to hide the poor taste with spiciness Even the side of black were under Come on this for My wife s black bean was nothing more than a frozen patty confirmed by waitress that it was not made on site re with a dab of on top but it was at least edible Props to or whoever the Oasis them from Our friend s were also edible but how hard is it to mess up The meat was only lightly seasoned and cut into rather large Thanks for providing the view over the but it is evident that the are on the food quality to repay the massive development of the new complex What a shame They would be better off some of the food trailer set up shop and handle the food and charge them parkingSave your money on food the however are great at am on a to avoid the normal rush of leaving church and t have been more disappointed A few on the food from our perspective Dip for very runny and not worth the cheeseburger came out burnt very burnt cheese pizza still ice cold in the middle when it Broccoli was also very cold Pretzel bun was very good on my sandwich Bloody Mary was pretty watery although the were good All of our sides people were lukewarm Plenty of chips Server was very nice and we still tipped but despite living in will never go back ever If the food was hot and not burnt this could be a great restaurantare not that high quality but nice view Limit of choice at the restaurantThis place cause of the view nothing else It s sad they rest on that and you pretty much HAVE to go here if you re new to So you re stuck with a relative to quality and it being EXPENSIVE super mediocre food and apathetic staffWhen I left the restaurant I intended to give it a three star review but later in the day both I and my sister got food poisoning Anyways good viewThe spicy chicken sandwich I ate made me super sick no one at my table of their meal except for person He ordered the and they were delicious because I did try one Other than that you are paying for the amazing breath taking view I will give it that the view is Spectacular But the food was notI normally don t write but this one I enjoy going to the Oasis cool place to take enjoy the view and the facility is great But seriously staff up to support the I mainly visit there for the in the Starlight in the general seating area are are stocking the instead of turning Long at the bar one bar tender at each bar for general I several times this year and its the same situation When you visit their and you see all these on staff To have these someone not or not paying attentionTerrible experience We ordered the Red Fish and it was so dry that we t get a fork and knife through it My husband tried to eat it since he never anything back and he t even chew it We told the waiter and he just like it was no big deal Also our that were wearing cover over their had to buy to put over their cover These from the gift shop were We will not be this mistakeEver since the divorce had been angry Sure would say she was just depressed but that t really capture the instinctive fury she felt towards other people Her most seething anger came when she crossed with anyone that of her ex Luckily she had found one thing that her rage tequila was a boat mechanic on Lake Travis and one or twice had been lake trash The memory of a freshly always cheered her up Newly split from she had made the at Lake Travis Then she that every bar bill she picked up was with Hell it was like a never ending deal wherever she goes At half price she could finally go back to the Oasis She had only been there once before but she knew the place well Terrible food that would kill your debit card and arrive at the table an hour after you ordered it multiple that were absolutely with She the way the place was decorated It her of the would watch The were terrible but she knew better than to order anything a bartender could screw up Tequila with a Light back One night after another great sunset and few too many tequila she saw on one of the lower with a girl knew was a dancer her way through the parking lot she caught sight of what she thought might be s truck She the Light bottle at the windshield on her way past the beat up old Chevy swore she d never come back The food was crap anyway Me tooThe one star is for the sunset which is literally the only thing that this restaurant even worth going to The view was amazing the hour wait for our table however was not By the time we were seated I had no appetite and was just done with the whole experience This restaurant is definitely quantity over quality The were and there were only to a line of over people The is outdated and the entire restaurant like it could use a fresh coat of paint to other I been to for a lovely sunset meal this restaurant is not at all the quality you d expect We around for in the heat for our table and I think a major part of the problem was that they t clear the empty tables fast enough Average food WAY TOO crowded Better food with a better atmosphere can definitely be found elsewhere in Don t waste your time and money here Would not recommend this restaurantIt all been said The view is pretty good by but only if you been to a pretty city In truth it s sad that such a great spot is taken by such a poor restaurant Let s do the math in plastic kiddy plus for the worst in plus more for shrimp with a scoop of rice and don t bother My advice If you go for the view hit the brewery It the better view anyway and though the beer is none too outstanding it does leave room to devour some quality eats once you get back to townThe food is always expensive and bad but the view up for it But this one the cake We were there for and were never met by a server I stopped two of them to ask if they would get our server for us and still nothing The band was great though The are awesomeWow probably the worst that i ever had life It was like eating card board I may go back to have a drink and watch the view but i never eat there againYou don t come for the service EVER you come for the view or do you After being seated and waiting a half an hour we finally received our water and but no chips or Our waitress was no where to be seen When she did arrive to take our order she did so with Of the four two of them were incorrect Even after talking to management to correct the poor service her attitude for the worse and we never saw her again We were entertaining out of state and to show them a spectacular view with a great experience We understand that get busy and wait staff sometimes have bad days but we were sorely disappointed We then spoke to another Manager to explain the situation and he cordially took off from the bill At this point the view really t that spectacular to have service so poorly The highlight of the evening was going to get ice cream at just outside Oasis to the rightReally bad experience tonight Stuck in an out of the way table and thus forgotten by the waitress waiting and still no or chips to management whose only concern was the table for the next group We decided to leave since our never up We were really looking forward to it and veryI m giving this place a star based on its food A on the service and a on the view The food is absolutely disgusting The was like eating cat food wrapped in a tortilla Seriously it almost made me vomit just it I took one for the team though and like it was delicious in front of my out of town family My mother in law though t hold back as she waved her hand back and forth yelling NO NO something s not right with this The which I ordered came back well done I for it medium and it had a pile of hard crusted that obviously we re old I ate it because I had no choice My t eat anything and thank god because they would have had diarrhea all the way home Someone needs to call to the rescue but I m afraid this place is making way to much money on the tourist attraction of lake TravisWe all known for that the food was not the draw it s the view and sometimes like last night the band We went to hear a friend s band First of all no pro band should have to play in an area that like a garage The stage area was not designed for sound to go out to the audience The band was the only good part of the night From the get go we could not find our waiter at all It took to get our first drink I also for water which took another hour to get We ordered the and margarita that have always been safe there Not The had whole complete with juice all over them and only the top layer was even edible and that was soggy too Both of us had stomach after eating them But the service or rather lack of was unbelievable We had to hunt our waiter down or go to the bar like this place could staff enough do make it worth an dollar drink in a plastic cup but they did not I people in line at the bar waiting for people who had tables but had to go up to the bar at The were as bad as the Then when we went to leave we t find our waiter again By this time I to speak to a manager who never came The staff said I don t know where he is I was so mad at the whole situation I came pretty close to walking out without paying which I have never done in my life I don t know that I can ever spend a penny in this place again It s not worth the frustration and to wait on yourself not to mention the food and I can watch the sunset anywhere but paying premium for horrible service and food never againDramatically hour wait to get food Unacceptable DO NOT RECOMMEND Learn how to run a restaurantSo my family and I went to this place to celebrate my Niece s special moment She was sworn in as C P A today We came here because we had such great about the place We did have a large party however a large restaurant as such should be to handle it For the most part the food was good The service however not so much our server may have been Someone s food came a long while AFTER the rest of the party and it was cold The response was what can I do I don t control the kitchen Everything we for drink problematic What in the world I m confused If you don t like people serving t for you can make or break your establishment Oh let s not forget A privileged table near us with a smaller party that had us with people with just And we to be seated upstairs and was told it t open until But then we seen several privileged people being seated upstairsI wonder what ever to this restaurant Service food down to the chip and gone down hill I was really looking forward to this restaurant What a major disappointment We came in and the host was on food and t even communicate with us That was just the beginning of the service It s very apparent the do not care about the customer nor the restaurant they worked for More importantly my food me of airplane food Check came out to for a party of I would not recommend this restaurant What a waste of space It s a beautiful viewThere was a bug in my drink t even waste my time with the food Scenery was the only thing nice Very old outdated placeDefinition of tourist trap Apparently this used to be a lovely classy place to sit and have a quiet drink over the lake Not With tacky gift a parking structure food and terrible service this place was an utter disappointment saidView is awesome Food is tasty Service absolutely Hour wait to get in Half hour before we even got water at table and going on waiting for our food with no sign of it People around us are getting grouchy tooThe of the lake are really the only thing this place going for it The food is borderline bad The second and last time I was there our server was lousy When about the red fish on the menu she said it s a fish that s red well not on your plate just red when it s in the water Seriously The is gaudy too I might addGuess not ready for the crowd huge group leaving due to the wait too bad none of the other are open everywhere open now but nothing is openUnfortunately this is a severe complaint regarding the treatment and service that my mother sister and friend experienced at the Oasis night Their party at the restaurant and was told that if they to sit on the patio to watch the sunset it was a first come first serve basis and had to find a table for themselves The hostess told them to stand by a table until they left that turned into an argument with another group who had been waiting for that same table and was obviously uncomfortable for the people at that table The never them gave them a menu or took their drink order for over an hour They had to track down a waiter who was extremely rude He told them that he was sat with ten tables at once and that he t care Where you re from who you are and what you want And when for a manager he flatly saying that they were on their own and t know where a manager was nor was he going to find one They did eventually have a waiter who took their order It took over an hour for them to get their food and he forgot my sister s order When it finally later it was cold Afterwards when he brought their bill it took him another to run it She finally found a manager He said that he would take care of it and never came back This is the most appalling experience and the most disgusting service I have ever yet despite all this they still tipped the waiter Why I don t know Most likely because they don t believe in spreading such vile treatment of people who are paying on people who should be serving them and have to make a livingIt s too bad they wasted a great location the view is the only thing going on here My year old prepared far better My top shelf drink had more water than the lake than a sardine with a whale sized bill I will not return I do not recommendEvery time we come here it is worse Our last visit was the last chance we will take of management staff are family of the ownership and clearly are not qualified or concerned about for poor performanceI m normally a fairly long winded reviewer but the Oasis is easily summed up Really bad food Really great view Your decisionWas in last month for a trip and we took a day trip to Lake Travis After spending some glorious on the boat we decided to stop by The Oasis for food After seeing all the we thought why not Let me tell you can be deceiving As have said the is HORRIBLE Bad customer service can be slightly if the food is good Well let me tell you it s not This is some of the worst I have ever had I got fish and they were bad The fish tasted like frozen fish with no seasoning My friend got and the chicken was questionable Of a group of ten no one finished their meal or Come here for the view or skip it all together This place a ton of potential because of the location but everything else is just not goodI m a lake Travis born and raised resident This past weekend I had a group of visiting for a party On their second night here I thought it would be so fun to end at the oasis for and dinner little did I know it would be the worst decision EVER ALL OF US except one the only one who t eat chicken got very ill Some got immediately sick and some within the next I got salmonella the I ever been in my life to the point I went to an emergency clinic Needless to say what was supposed to be a wonderful weekend got cut short because of Miss handled chicken We to report it and the manager could have less We will NEVER take there again Such a disappointment a place that used to be great turned into a money driven place Very sad I hope someone does something about it DONT EVER EAT HERE if you just go go get a drink and nothing else If I could give negative I wouldZero t an option so they get one Went with a small group and surprise no separate Took to get a cup of water margarita and pay the bill for six people Service was terrible management and unless you sit right on the edge not much of a view I will not be back nor would I recommend this place to anyoneI had a nice time many ago at the oasis so when we were in town recently we decided to stop by again It was such a disappointment Very Service is terrible We ahead for seating and the hostess that we put our down on a seating list to guarantee seating but when we got there the supposed seating list is non existent When we got to the table the waiter took forever to show up The waiter was confused as to which tables he was covering The waiter took so long to bring us our and appetizer we ended going somewhere else for the The t all that good it was already cold by the time it got to the table We definitely won t be going backI have been to a lot of tourist traps but this one is truly sad This restaurant is up on a lake Travis so everyone goes there to dine and enjoy a sunset view I m sure the view can be nice if you are lucky enough to get seated in one of the tables next to the outer railing and have good weather but because the place is massive and an army we got stuck way in the back away from the view behind an armada of tables with patio blocking the entire view The thing they don t tell you is that the sun will eat you alive on the without an umbrella All those that people get then block the view for those further back So this was disappointment for us No view for you The second disappointment was the poor quality of the food We had a large party so we ordered many different and everyone ended up unhappy with what they got Even the were sad Strike Strike came when we got the bill you then realize clearly that you for the food that you got So in summary at least half the people that show up to this restaurant they will end up with a view but everyone will end up with expensive food Needless to say we will not be going here again this experience was enough for me and my family byeThank you Oasis for giving me the idea of my list here on Yelp I my family here for what was suppose to be a dinner experience but in return gave me further reason to never suggest your establishment to anyone again The only thing I d say was nice was that we didnt have to wait for a table but then again it was on a night Other than that service was just utter crap Our waiter was probably one of the most impolite server I have ever had going out to eat No introduction of himself No to make a minute of small talk while a couple people were what to get No offering to try and help the undecided decide on something No stopping by to see if our food was or how the table was doing after we got our food a sarcastic attitude because we two of for rather than alcoholic the check to early and making everybody feel rushed like you had better to do And for just saying Here when you literally off the check on the table And for telling another waitress that you wished that our table would hurry up and close out which I walking to the In the that I lived in and several times that I been to the Oasis I have never ever had an experience where I walk away saying to myself Damn I can t wait to be back Personally the Oasis literally people for the view that they have realistically their service and their food and seriously suck Oasis You have officially beenThe Oasis is a beautiful center with allot of potential but they need to get rid of their leasing agent and this restaurant The food is the wait times are ridiculous for the amount of space that is available and it remains empty which me that they are The group of sat behind the entry desk with daft on their every time someone came in to ask of their tables were ready The food is disgusting You can taste the poor quality uncleanliness of the food The have a metallic aftertaste and the bar filthy I had on an occasion eaten here with my husband after a realtor recommend it but it s a tourist trap and a disgusting one at that Not only that but I out with a very bad Gluten reaction which had me miserable and for days after a few of salad The second time I came here with an out of town friend and just to show her the view which is the saving grace along with the eclectic askew in the front like a long overdue estate sale We ended up at the bar on the third floor which the Oasis restaurant vehemently was even there when I had politely if any were available nearby I was able to take of their out the door with me after they d the terrible treatment my I were given The bar upstairs simple but the quality was a million times better a fraction of the costSitting here right now With extremely slow service I also over the waitress another server if they spoke because she assumed that we t I just want to get up and go But we brought family from out of townThis place t even deserve one star Terrible guest service We t mind waiting to be seated because we knew it would take about an hour to sit but what me and my husband off is they forgot to put our on the waiting list After waiting an hour and saw the restaurant closed sign at the door we the host how much longer do we have to wait The girl don t remember her name but the one with the fake took about to find our name She was slowly down the page on the tablet t even look at our face Finally they decided to seat us The table that we were seated was blocked by a pillar We politely if we can seat somewhere else after and being forgotten And there were lots of empty tables Of course they t move us And we end up leaving the restaurant Wasting timeHorrible food and horrible service are great Save your money We went and several other people that were seated after us were way ahead of us It to get on water Food was mediocre and bland Drove from downtown through the only to be disappointed by the food and serviceTerrible service The worst ever The place is going down in a hurry Lazy uncaring staff Too uncaring to be rude Some are super rude are horrendous due to massive disorganization and chaos of empty tables yet are over an hour or two always Food is mediocre at best are not edible The wait area used to allow you to order some food now you cant You are lucky to find a chair to sit on The view is good and the are good That is about itThe service here is We almost before we saw our waiter and another to order Our food way before our s like before The server the top of my bun on the floor with no apology or any sort of reaction We had to ask separate for a replacement This place like it is run by over privileged who care more about chatting with their than they do about the customer If you like terrible service cold food with a beautiful view then this is the place Our response to any slight change in menu or request was We don t do that here because we re too busy Translation We could give a crap about you give us your moneyExtremely disappointing The view was gorgeous The food not so much Presentation horrible and the taste was bland The server like he t hear anything we for He made multiple to get us when it he could gotten them all at onceThe customer service here totally We were a party of and at around on a There were numerous tables with gorgeous available but the hostess to seat us somewhere downstairs with only a view of the No lake view When we to be to another empty table right next to where we were being seated but with a better view we were told NO very rudely First reason those are tables and we wont let you join them So we even agreed to sit on tables Then the Reason those tables will seat people and you are only This when there was NO crowd in the So we just away without eating I am never going there and cannot recommend it eitherHorrible service while writing the review I actually over a server tell a guest that it was too busy for them to order food for a margarita which was watery I think they had tuned in that I was writing a review and me if I chips I would come solely for the viewI just left here and had a terrible experience The food runner a plate of lettuce all over me and my purse by accident The manager me a shirt from the gift shop which I did not take but when I that my be she There was never an offer to pay for my purse to be The food was mediocre and the service was When my and were it took another for the server to reappear so I could ask him for ketchup Yes the view is fantastic but there are other on Lake Travis that also have fantastic and provide a much better experiencefor frozen shrimp for two I don t care if you have a view directly into s Never again The only thing worse than the food was the service I can t fathom why this garbage dump t shut down yet Go next door same if not better view good food great beer and much better servicegreat spot to catch the sunset long wait for that when our chips and came out there was a spider web with a dead spider hanging into the chips I was so hungry I until I found a long thick strand of red hair in the chips when my vice came out without the rum floater I ordered specifically I t ignore the spider the web and the hair we got out of that place right after the sun went downThe view is amazingly beautiful and it s very serene however the food is just I ordered the and my friend ordered the and it was terribly dry and bland I would only go for the view and that s pretty much itSo if you read me you know my review are about the food and only the food The food here is just so so bad I had I normally don t eat those anywhere except my favorite place s tamale house But there was nothing else that on the menu And Totally gross beef with no flavor My hubby had the fish and that smelled no really it smelled Not a good sign for fish He gave me a bite to my dismay and well that stunk just like it smelled I give a for service as well Our waiter had way to many tables and t keep up took forever to get anything So in all fairness I have to give a personal for Awesome view and great atmosphere I guess if your a drinker and like to watch the sun set this is a great spot Just don t eatTook out of town never again The service was terrible rude in addition to the place being dirty This used to be a very nice friendly venue now a bad tourist trapThis place a nice view Now the We were stale chips The we were were so watered down I in with a buzz and out sober The redfish I had was so bland I would not be interested in it again for sure Another guest had a steak that was so spicy he t eat it of the at a table of were wrong Considering all of the above the food was I m not sure how an amazing multimillion dollar facility like this can have such bad food and The place was but word will get around if they don t fix itWent for a friend s birthday Waiter and manager they t do separate The have like separate in a probably million facility and can t do separate They gave the check to the of us and told US to do the math figure out each item that was ours and then multiply by to add the tax and tip Like we want to do that at p m with loud music Not very customer service The food was the equivalent to Cabana and they for and for Will not go back The view is beautiful but the rude service leaves one unhappy once the sun setYes the are great but this is a restaurant and as such the quality of the food is important and The Oasis is sorely in that department I am so not a picky eater but I could barely choke down my chicken wrap for The lettuce chicken and were all pretty much the same color which is not a good sign Plus they put nice mixed UNDER the wrap while stuffing it full of old lettuce Gross The dessert was awful too Key Lime Pie that I m told since it was my first time eating it had the totally wrong texture to it All of the food is grossly and not good at all I would not eat here againlesson learned Trust the There need some help Ordered the food and in less the it was on the table No real food of any quality should be ready I felt sorry for the The place is a mess and really t see anyone cleaningHave the ever eaten here This place desperately need their menu from The view is amazing but the food is terribleplace currently No see infestation outside would not recommend outdoor seating until this Food is still mediocre at best service is fine and the view is still good but not good enough to make up for constantly at yourself to get those blood sucking you can t see I come to The Oasis restaurant about times now and the story is almost always the same come for the view but deal with the mediocre food We had this time and they were a little tough and wanting of a little more seasoning The chips and were good Someone got a fried shrimp that was very tasty actually The view of Lake Travis is phenomenal right now with all the filling up the lake imagine seeing ugly dirt in the middle of the lake when the water level is low But what people really need to know is that our meal out on the balcony felt horrible today There was a constant barrage of No see aka biting everybody at our table and all nearby tables We could see everybody scratching and at themselves The word swarm would not be an understatement with how it felt to be outside today You can t see them on you but we to see some that got stuck on the white see pic The staff informed us of what they were and there was nothing they could do for us other than to keep the on Their gift shop homeopathic style herb non insect repellant but it did not work for us I had a spray but even that t completely fix the nuisance I don t know what the answer is but they need to find a better way to combat the infestation before leaving outside to be bitten by that are blood sucking and can often harbor numerous disease causing much like The staff they can t spray for these because of their proximity to the lake I m skeptical but I take their word for it until I hear otherwise More for the curious en m I hate These are worse than more aggressive and incessant I was embarrassed to have from out of town with me for this terrible experience Will never come again in May JuneFood was just Service t good at all All it had going for it was the location and the view I know I can do better than this place with excellent food service and view from like andThey have very Bad customer service We stopped by this place on our trip The Oasis a very good view of the lake but that s about it The food the customer service The waitress set us down on the floor on a table outside by the patio by the fact that we to be seated outside we immediate that we t have a good view I came back to ask the front receptionist to be transferred to a lower level and was by a blunt comment What s wrong with the spot you seated I Everything I t like it up there is it possible we be seated on the floor Then we were taken to a spot by the sun We if they can put up an umbrella to block out the sun and got a response No we don t put up We ordered a beer and a The food was eh t impressive but we knew what we were getting so that was the reason why we ordered just the We left after that Food customer service great view They were banking on the view anyhow I may come back but just for a quick rest stopTo start the night there was no service at our isolated table in the walkway Once min later we to be to a better section After only being seen for every min we finally got our food With hair in it Plenty of other to see the sunset then this placeCold food food poisoning My husband who rarely ordered the Chef s Special Trio and the food was very cold He sent it back to get and it was returned just as cold Not to mention it did not taste well My chicken tasted off not like any I had food also cold not as bad as his I got pretty sick the next day I never thrown up that hard before We will definitely NOT be or to anyone star for the decent viewOn vacation in This place a great view however the food and service did not live up to its view The server never came back to check on us and at one point said I m backed up Very disappointed in this experienceThis is the place to go if you are looking to lose weight My friend was the for consecutive days after eating their special Their view is great by the wayrestaurant is very dirty look like they never been are broken bathroom poorly made what a shame if they fixed it up would be a nice place to go toBeautiful mediocre and well I could barely stomach the I could find better in a package at so we t stay for dinner Also out waitress like she her lifeFound a piece of gum in my drink The waiter like it was mine and t want to anything Poor service This place is truly awful Not worth the viewService was good The vegetarian were awful large of broccoli and a couple of of we had the order for Go for and sunsetAs someone who grew up in and have been here many times I know that this place is only good for and the view But today I came here with my who had never been before were new to They would not let us have a table in the sun unless we had a party of Then to sit in the sun at the table we we were here first Hostess to be of her manager Enjoy your one star managerHostess was the individual I have experienced in a restaurant No to ever returnthe view of the sunset is as for the food That was horrible My wife food like canned cat food and it smelled horrible too We ordered some to distract us from the terrible food Unfortunately that t work either since the tasted like juice I would come back to see the view but I t stick around to eat And the service definitely We tried to wave down several numerous times and they just straight up our tableIt s an amazing setting at The Oasis Too bad they are not staffed to handle the influx of coming to listen to the live music and eat It s first come first Three of us received our food and it was after we finished before our fourth person was Three times we had to check with our waiter and waiter made us feel like we were in the wrong Service is terrible just go and danceFacility is very nice view is amazing But the restaurant is not awful service and really bad foodFood is very Bland don t do Chicken Strawberry pina pretty good Banana Pina is AssI sent my here to celebrate their th wedding anniversary I knew the view would take their away And it t disappoint But the food and wait service did disappoint big time The waiter was horrible and t attentive My had to hunt him down to get The beef t resemble fresh beef The meat was dry and days old My purposely on the beef to make sure they t going to be to anyone else Because they did not eat it I feel bad that I The Oasis They left feeling like they wereDon t get me wrong please do come here for the scenic view It s magnificent yes it s Food is mediocre but luckily the price point the quality of the food Not too Ask to sit outside for the view Usually you would need to wait for but I went on a weekday at right in Bravo Spend your time to snap totally worth itIt s a real shame this business t hold themselves to a higher standard They got such a wonderful view Stick to beer in a bottle and you be Anything else and you likely be disappointedHandicap parking The law is for every parking path to the restaurant Your parking garage where you have handicap parking is away This area should not be included You have three handicap parking next to the restaurant unfortunately you have them blocked for Valet parking only These should be ashamed Why would you want blowing out mist of water Is this a theme park or a restaurant Just what I water thrown at me and my food The manager stated that the most was on a timer and would turn off at sun set at night and I was still taking a shower from the mist Nice Eat before you go to this place The food mixed with water was terrible Just buy wear a bathing suit for the mist and enjoy the sunsetHorrible experience Went for a dinner and got stuck with a first time server for a group of Our food had no flavor and were water down Ever time our server came around her response was I be right with you which after the third you just feel We a and I saw all the tables turning but ours We a manager and his response was they have so many people they can t please everyone Which to me Well that was a great experience Never again Thanks for the view though That s about the only good thing about our experienceHonestly the view was great but everything else was horrible They sat us at a table with broken chips on the floor The server was super nice but the restaurant was dirty The carpet was gross The outside view of the lake is the saving grace of this place We were so out we took a few t order food and leftUpon arrival we were told the wait would be to an hour No problem Gave them our name and number watched sunset and And And Our were getting really hungry and after waiting over we checked in with the host He informed us that according to their system we d already been seated We spoke to the manager and t even given so much as an apology Took our business elsewhere where we were with respect So disappointingKoko ni kite wa wa no no oNasty Bad service bad and TERRIBLE food Tourist trap yes but honestly just nasty Bartender rude dried out and here are some of their best saladI flew in from out of state for a wedding I was there night with a large wedding party I never seen such awful service and rude management for in a seating for which was spread between two tables on two different When people up they t about to help us seat everyone The party took into their own and an empty table and over themselves which in a scolding from the manager There was one waitress for the entire party If you a refill or a drink you were on your own as all she could be to do was take the initial Food was still coming out when most people had already eaten All in all an absolutely awful experience after an otherwise beautiful daySo I haven t been out here in about or so other than to attend and Coffee and I can say with certainty I will never come back and will with again certainty never recommend this total complete cluster of a joint to anyone ever again The real Oasis in the fire agoThis place at after waiting to even get in but we received our food at Though the view is pretty it was a long stressful experience Definitely can find a better place and better food elsewhereWell the view is five As far as the food and service maybe just maybe one star We at and we re on a late lunch We ordered a round of and For we ordered chicken and shrimp of some form The first round of came out fairly fast as did complimentary chips and As far as a second round of not so much I went to the bar and got them myself At we still had no in sight nor a waitress So I went to a manager to explain to him the key element to a great dining experience is service He to miss that point in our discussion So the finally and I had better happy My best advice is to enjoy the view and Don t expect much moreTOURIST TRAP Little yellow every where In your In your food And yes they bite Although the view was great food is horrible Bad service They do not care about you Save your money Go to mount for a great view instead It s freeWhere to begin with this I had the joy of going to the Oasis about ago and it was a great experience I was excited to repeat the sentiment and was sorely disappointed The view was equally as beautiful as four ago however with multiple First the parking situation was a sorry attempt for all I can assume is population control With two surface lots and a garage parking it was still a farce We and after waiting in line for were told it would be a hour wait no problem to be Then we went next door to the Oasis Brewery saved for a later review I must say the shopping area grown with much diversity and to do while you wait for your highly table After exactly an hour and a half we were to our table The service was a far cry from desirable While our waitress tried desperately she was with far too many tables Our food was cold after a minute wait I was also told there were no available for my chicken Our highly dinner was a sorry experience with Cisco food BUT there was a view Too bad the sun had set and it was pitch black out before we got to enjoy itOne star because of the amazing view that s pretty much what you re paying for everything else Service is run by lazy around sThere s a reason why this place bad You been The only good thing about this place is the VIEW The food literally is so disgusting They don t make their own vegetarian so cancel that out The furniture is so cheap It s sad because this place potential The carpet even out WOULD BE UPSET AND School lunch is much better than this foodDo not come to the oasis The service and so does the food This place grown way too big for its For It took so long to get a cocktail from our server we got and finished from the bar before we even saw our server again An over all total disappointment When we our server for water he told us to go to the bar Save your gas and money and go the restaurant near your houseThis was my third terrible experience at the Oasis so likely my last in on a beautiful evening and happily agreed to a min wait for a family of After getting some in Joe s Cantina and waiting min went to the host stand to ask where we sat on the list Was told we were to seated on the they use where the reservation was tied to my name and phone number so this more like gross mismanagement of their seating tool than a reservation When I to speak with a manager Billy I got nothing other than Sorry man Can we get you a table now for which my clear answer on this third strike was no Better luck with the than a local family willing to beIn theory I to love it I used to go and ago in college and should have it in glory when I learned that it had been rebuilt after a fire Why t I listen to myself The meat and tasted like cat food it was an odd shade of gray and the fish were far too fishy The sad thing is that we took it to go being polite instead of leaving on the table untouched and we ended up the to go container in the in the parking lot only to discover that ten other to go filled with food now in the trash as wellLong to wait some more for horrible service and even worse This establishment is a shame for and should not be a hot spot If you have to come here Grab a beer with or less people and enjoy the sunset Call ahead so you don t have to wait as long Wish I could rate this place zeroThe Oasis terrible service is slow to bring is slow to bring chips terrible food and an amazing view Do not go to this restaurant if you want something good to eat do go if you want the viewYou make a huge line now to get into the worst restaurant of Food and service wiseSo that I felt a hint of food poison coming on I felt sick This podge of food is BAD THEY NEED TO GET A CHEF that can create something good this is nasty I threw up Yes I They have a wonky faucet that t turn off Great waitress she went you set yourself up with that I just and Too to finish that meal She t notice how we both only took one piece and it asideOutstanding view it is truly remarkable view of Lake Travis and spectacular at sunset Unfortunately it any skill at and a meal Three of us at on a night which was too late for an outside seat so we were to the third floor for live music in the bar Outside seating was immediately available However it was a bar and the music was live and too loud Go for the music and view but not the food or conversation band was far too loud to talk The service once we finally sat was horrendous We ordered a margarita chips and while on a meal The margarita was small and chips and tasted like it was from a container My wife and daughter are both vegetarian but there was only a garden on the menu and neither really a sandwich We finally decided to pay and leave but it took ten to find the waitress We left and then another for valet parking Note the large sign that the valet works for only They built a beautiful place on top of a great hill with a spectacular view the rest of the placeThis place received a star because of its view Although if you had a house over a hill the lake you can enjoy this from your house as this place nothing else special about it I felt like I wasted my time going here as the was not even worth it The guest service desk was very rude and not willing to We had if they could see how much longer our wait would be and the response we received was there are people on this list So there is no way for me to look you up Like what kind of a system and service is that in which you can t provide an update to your guest The hostess outside was way and helpful For such a huge place they do not have enough like why would people have to wait min on line to use the The food at this place is not even worth going for or waiting over an hour and half for as it is sub par and no quality to its food It s by far the worst eats in which is a shame The service was probably the worst part of this place It beat the food as we received so much attitude and horrible service For such a huge place have more waiter I don t even know how they make money with the service they provide Our waitress was slow and incompetent Normally I don t like to use harsh but she got the wrong and t give anyone the correct we ordered She kept off the and by one end of the table instead of individually each person their order She us for something we t get and was confused when we her why we were twice She t even place one of the dish and when we sent the bill back to get she forgot to bring back an check Also she only checked up on us every min How would we ever be able to get refill and such as there were no other waiter or working in the either The outdoor seating is even a longer wait and honestly I don t think it s worth it People say this place is good for but I t There is a separate line you stand on to get and there is no real place to chill outside Actually there not much waiting space in general All in all if your visiting from out of town and have other on your list I would keep this on the way bottom if you really have an interest in going hereI need to preface this review by that I m a little or jaded or both I live in the Lake Travis area and I have a similar view to The Oasis every evening so I m not by it That said it is a pleasant enough looking place somewhat of a monstrous building atop a west facing hill It to be noisy and touristy crowded on the I with a couple of and out of Baby Back the Big and the Red Fish The Baby were so so I could get similar from warming up a slab of from H E B The was and certainly no bargain to The fish was the real kicker Redfish that you re getting some variant of Red Snapper or Red Drum However a careful read of the menu that it s Red Fish When I about this I was informed that this to the recipe which made the whitefish used reddish After tasting the result I m thinking that one of the two restaurant trade of cheap or were used I could live with that But the flavor yeah something was definitely off No one got sick but the consensus was that this was a fillet that had been stuck at the back of the freezer got freezer burned and was brought out at the last minute Truly awful If you must come come for the view and after dinner This place only star on the Scale as noted below out of Come to good Would be passing on after finishing a meal here out of Come to Mary good Would be being seen eating here by Mother Mary out of Come to good Would be a beer here with Dad out of Come to the good t have my last supper here out of Come to Nobody good I t have my penultimate supper here eitherBeautiful view great and terrible terrible food I was with a party of and EVERYONE their food It all tasted and like microwave I ordered a cheese and it seriously was no better than a you would order at a baseball or football game My came in little and the t crispy I definitely don t recommend anyone going there for dinnerWe at and left just a little before The service I have seen in my life The waitress no She one thing and the other then she for a while The check was incorrect they for we t buy The positive is that the view was amazingI gone here times and I never had a good experience The last time I went was on to celebrate my mother in law s nuptials We were seated immediately we got there at so it t busy yet We were seated in the sun but that s at that time of day the sun quickly so I knew we would be in the soon We were in the by the time the server to come see us I believe her name was Anyway we had enough time to choose our and before she even came by to say she would be right back Well thank God that she was kind enough to come back after that with some water Then she promptly took our drink and left we had to stop her to order an appetizer you have got to be me Anyway the appetizer came soon enough but she let us all go dry in our and our Way to go I have a year old and its SO easy to deal with a thirsty two year old Our appetizer was gone before she to take our entree order The food came and since this is the Oasis and they don t have to focus on food quality or service for it tasted mediocre at best The chicken are tasteless and the beef probably barely get any attention Anyway we t see her again until she the check We had to stop other people to get water no way we were going to run up the tab on like we to at this point t you know it at group of is big enough for auto gratuity Lovely now when I was a server when we had a table that was large enough for automatic gratuity we made DAMN SURE we took care of them What can you do with piss poor service when your tip is non negotiable We were there from had we not gotten piss poor service she could have gotten in another table before sunset but that s none of my business huh And it was the most embarrassing of my life If you want to go to a restaurant get piss poor service and mediocre food with a view of a dry lake then go here Otherwise run Don t waste your money Go somewhere nice County Line on the River and County Line on the Hill are FANTASTIC On the Hill some great on their porch with much better service and food Make sure and order their home made breadIf I could give the restaurant I would I read the and mediocre food with a great view The view Sadly the restaurant food and service did not The food was worse than bad It was disgusting No one in my party could even eat the food The table next to us left their entire dinner behind The only thing that was edible was the chips and The service was equally over to pay the check and they t that busy The owner should be ashamed all these horrible and nothing The food is from the microwave or from a can An expensive waste and we had to stop for fast food The ladies were gross and half were out or order If you never been it s worth it for the view The property the potential to be something special but apparently no one Pitykiller Service was AWFUL Took my family that was visiting from out of town there and Out of the tables available early lunch only were being used that were close to the glass ledge when we to be closer to the edge and out in the sun the waitress literally rolled her at us and threw the menu s down on the new table FOREVER for the tolerable food We literally had to hunt down our non waitress only to catch more attitude for more ranch and Tea and we min for it As former waitress and a tipper I personally felt the horrible waitress t deserve a tip at all I can go eat somewhere else for a lot less money with a lot less attitude and still get A LOT better faster service I was embarrassed to take my visiting family there and will not return Luckily they were so smitten with the that it t make the whole visit a waste I do not recommend this place at all Hula Hut on lake is WAY betterstar for atmosphere and the waiter was really sweet Everything here Should have read the before coming hereDon t go there with a large group They don t take and the call ahead is a joke We had to wait for over and a half to be seated and then they t even have the number of we had Our evening was ruined and all of my group were beyond exhausted by the time we left NEVER AGAINWhy oh why do I keep coming back After in I maybe been here on or I m always why so few as soon as I m seated The service is abysmal one water refill in The food is garbage you can still taste the freezer on the The view a blinding sunset I guess hour and minute ticket time for and child on a is inexcusable And then I pay full price after I turn down your throw away free I assume exist on the menu as the thing given for free to every table for garbage service I m done Oasis you re dead to meDO NOT GO HERE FOR THE FOOD The food was absolutely horrible the restaurant itself was filthy and the younger staff was completely uninterestedUpdate We stop here every year after vacation Honestly this place to get worse ahead for which they t take Thankfully it t busy at all We were a party of and of the were so I for tables of outside with a view They said they might not be able to get the tables beside each other and I said I assumed they would try their best and get them as close as possible but I was wrong We walk outside and although there are tables with a beautiful view they don t seat either table there They bring us off to the side and have the sit really far away from us even though they had so many tables available Both tables had a view of just I t ask to sit outside in degree weather for a view of I had to ask times for a different table Again there was plenty availability and it was near so it t an issue of no there Once we finally got seated again I can t even see our other table the server sense why at a busy lunch time that this place t busy at all It was an act of congress to get our we ordered and a refill of chips t come until after our food so our was cold The only good thing about this place is the view that is IF they want to give you a table with a view The food was I ordered a chicken salad on top of avocado and spinach It said it had black but I think it literally only had black in it I love black and I was a bit disappointed of how little it had Customer Service needs a lot of workHorrible Bloody Mary and bad service Took to get my check and then my card back It s all about the view here so eat a little something beforehandGreat sunset view but perhaps the worst service we had in Waitress was most of the evening Table next to us was seated after us and got their food a half hour before us We tracked down a manager who to his credit out and some of the food which was just Go there for sunset but skip the restaurantI because of my brother who will be at UT After my and I him off we decided to go to a place where a nice view and good food according to my She been there before like twice with her but I never have We drove the way to deep inside the mountain where the restaurant s It was a little bit Finally we got there and the hostess expression less no smile took us to our seat And we for the lounge seat because we to sit outside I know that everyone goes there for view Anyways she put us right next to a group of people when there were so many empty We had to say excuse us so many times to get into our The were tightly together so it t convenient The fan which was on was right above our making much noise that our waiter t even hear me While we were eating dust from the fan fell on our table You have no idea how bad it We to switch our table but I t want to make no scene The food the most important probably more important than atmosphere was not so many either The was so little for It was in a little bowl probably smaller than a rice bowl which you could see if you go to a restaurant And there was chopped lettuce under so basically the real avocado portion was small The entree I ordered with chile and pineapple sauce with some rice and BAD the fish was dry badly seasoned and the were so bitter for some reason we had a good service though since he checked on us twice or three times while we were eating the were filled promptly and he t rush us to finish eating Our check t that big because we only had one and one entree But still I t stop thinking that the are Absolutely the view is good but it is a restaurant If you want to sell food then make it goodHorrible The service is horrible the food is disgusting but the view is insane Avoid at allWhat going to the Oasis pleasant is the view Otherwise there s not much to say I continue to give them the benefit of the doubt with their menu and each time my food disappointing They really don t need to care about the quality of their food when they have lovely and At my last visit we ordered It s pretty hard to mess up Then my daughter bean and cheese Again you would think that s something easy They to butcher the The were with all of junk piled on top easy enough to remove what we t want but then I the The put WHOLE pinto on the chips Just scattered about and covered with very little cheese Living in different of my whole life I have never seen anyone put whole pinto on In it s Then I that the that came with the were also whole pinto Again not what you normally seen as the that come with I our server why they used whole pinto She said that this is a different kind of restaurant I told her that it s unfortunately they have chosen to make their as if we are in the north east She then admitted that they don t have any What You have a lot of on the menu and no Good grief But like I said people don t really go to the Oasis for the food so it t matter a hill of to them I now know in the future to eat at home before I go because the Oasis is about the lake and the sunsetI generally like this place But the upstairs bar starlight a funeral and put zero outside the door It s a bar You don t expect to walk into a funeral Maybe they should put a sign outside to warn people I guess that was too complicated of a concept for them Thankfully the bartender in the oasis first floor lobby bar was friendly Slow but at least friendlyFood is absolutely horrible If you want someone to steal your money go here Yes there are great sunset but you can x better food and the SAME view at several other Go thereThe view can t be beat but that is all this place going for it Everything took so long Taking our order the food coming out especially the check We tried to be so patient The table next to us sat down after us and were almost done eating by the time we got our food Just really slow slow service We won t be backFirst of all leaving a review of star does not make me happy or excited However my at the Oasis was so bad I simply can t give it any more First the hostess t know where she was going to she took our party of nearly people around and around until she stopped someone else to help her find the table It was hot This can t be However the that are mounted outside t work and the did bend properly leaving us sweating We ordered chips and It literally tasted like a bag of stale and a jar of had been on our table it took to get our food the entree came and I have never taken a bit of anything so terrible in all my days Horrible need i go on I think notgreat view stick with the beer only and you cannot go wrong if you order anything else you will wonder why you just spent money on that and did not stick with the plan of only beerWent here with family food was horrible and view was great but not going backThe only thing we was the view of the lake and the sunset We had a min wait When we finally had a table we still had to wait while they up While we other were rude to us for standing in their way when we had no other place to stand since the hostess us to wait by her for our table As we were walking to our table the waitress behind us was to the other waitress about the traffic jam there was while our group was trying to make it to our The waitress to push her tray against my back The food and are the food t all that AT ALL My sister had a side of the with broth and I you not the cup only came with about The rest was just broth We don t see ourselves to this placeFood is over priced and not tasty at all better food Surrounding and are the main reason I go here The Oasis on Lake Travis needs to up their food game a lot Don t waste your money here go to the brewery instead Amazing and funTerrible food and even worse service We got seated right away as it t too busy being a night However we for before anyone ever came to our table We were sweating and thirsty Then finally a came and we ordered all of our food appetizer dinner because we t sure when we would see him again We get our appetizer came ten later We finished our appetizer then for thirty before we saw our server again When he came he the check We just sat there awkwardly looking at him confused about why we were getting our check when we were still waiting for the we had ordered The restaurant had pretty much out by then and he told us that the kitchen got well we ordered our dinner an hour and a half before that Food comes out and is disgusting We will NOT be there and there are plenty of other where we can eat and enjoy the view of Lake Travis Suffice it to say we have a good story Don t waste your money here Or at least don t order the food The t even that goodThis is the first restaurant I have ever told a server that the food was bad at Its just not how I was raised to complain but dang this place was bad THE FOOD There were three of us and we everything we got The spicy chicken sandwich was neither spicy nor good It was bland too thick for the seasoning method imagine of un seasoned white meat and came with maybe half a teaspoon of the ranch i ordered more but when it came it t spicy either and even when I added it to the the still to be the chicken sandwich ever The pretzel bun was good though The was not excessively large but I did not finish it instead to go back to eating the chips and rather than force it down The burgher was than the chicken sandwich but still not deserving a spicy tag it t have one but it made me more upset that my spicy chicken sandwich was bland The t work for any of us and the was wrong House were good The were not good The spice was off and made everything taste cloyingly sweet We for a to go plate for it because my t eat it and we t want to leave a full plate on the table The perfect margarita t great what to say about this I think its subjective My mother in law thought it more tequila I thought it less Probably don t judge the drink on this review for that reason THE RESTAURANT Came for the view for the deck spent staring at the crowd of people between me and the lake Crowded does not begin to sum it up Mother in law went down to the edge of the deck to see the water was to return to her table by a server I got upset when I there were tables at the edge of the deck that were empty and never got filled but that they me against a wall with no view of the lake Service was slow like really slow Place was hot but not unbearably so because they had and a lot of those made it hard to move around though Most telling was the fact that the table next to ours had their because they never got their food and when a server that none of us had finished our food and we all dissatisfied she very helpfully to send over a manager I up and that there were three each talking to different tables They all like they were and we just decided that we t want to be there any more We just our bill and left The only thing we finished from the whole meal was my The Bill Should have costI just don t get it The food and service are always at best and the are ridiculously highThis place is beautiful and it could be a great business if the owner were more careful about customer service We went yesterday and stand in the front desk to ask for a table there were teens chatting away when we for a table they said they were all booked and we have to wait min We away and found about empty tables on the top part we sat down and one boy came and gave us and silverware after that for min nobody up to take the order or anything there were plenty of serving tables next to us and cleaning but when we to have our taken they said yes someone is coming It was by far the worst time on all our weekend Never ever going back to the restaurantOne star for the view and passable friendly service The Oasis should be embarrassed about just about everything else the consistently mediocre low effort food they have for plus and the remarkably beer selection Note there are craft within and one within There are two for this trap so I am bothThis place a great view but the food is absolutely terrible My friend got the fish which came with a salad aka a spoon of on a few of lettuce The i got was dry and the felt like rubber This place is not only but it s grossMy wife and I brought a friend who never so her friend could enjoy the view It might have been fun if we had actually gotten service Or if our table had t been by bees The staff was disaffected inconsiderate and incompetent There to be better than this place I will not returnThe are amazing they used to have so many I felt bad that it burned down due to a thunder storm I remember coming to this place ago But here is why I give it a low rating The food When you are hungry it t bad but after you finish you get this weird after taste I guess it won t be as bad if you are drunk but don t come here just for the food please don t reflect the quality It way for what you get especially since it t taste as good as you would think For example last weekend I payed for chicken plus the and rice it comes with and water plus the tip which they included in the price with out They automatically include the tip when you call for the check I don t like this at all because you have no control if you get bad service but I never got bad service so I am not too upset about this point If you are looking for a good place to eat stay away but if you seek the hill country atmosphere and the amazing you must come here But you be to eat hereThis place is such a trap Sunset but awful service and food My father in law visiting had glass in his food Worse yet our waiter t apologize and t any portion of the meal I was and we covered his meal as I was so embarrassed So seething mad but t want to make a public scene we left without it to management s attention Will never returnDO NOT COME HERE The only good thing is the view Still not worth the money and experience Was told will be our server a couple of other her by us chips and brought and took the order for a party or that sat AFTER us She finally came back after and us Ice was being thrown over the balcony onto our table and us we informed and was told that she will tell a manager No manager came to apologize no server We t even know who our server was because people came up our table When I finally who our server was t make our experience any better Often abandoned us and food took forever Every table around us sat down an hour after us and got their food before us After we left no manager was to be found at the front desk OVERALL bad management If I can give zero I wouldOh good lord a better chicken wrap At least their are red The food was just plain TERRIBLE at the Oasis I mean really really terrible Questionable old chips poor service Man Oasis you have screwed up such a beautiful thing There is also a Billy s Brew N Q here I would go there Not that it s anything special either see my review of the S location but their even moldy were red It s such a shame because the view is fantastic and the building and it s bring out a very adult World feel Apparently being on that big hill forced the food delivery trucks to come once every two Definitely go for a beer and the food but don t eat the foodFun place to take visiting from out of town great scenery the lake the food is dismal save save save your money and have your main course elsewhere I would recommend the onlyOh my gosh I am so excited to write this review It was literally the worst experience at a restaurant I ever had I normally give a lot of leeway for because it is a tough gig dealing with people who only like to complain ask how long til they are seated almost make the hostess want to throw themselves over a balcony ledge with a rope tied around their neck I get that I been there it was a holiday weekend so wait times are higher I get that too What I don t get is a group of forgotten even with those handy dandy vibrating table that I was real excited to use We were at the hour mark when a server on her smoke break informed us that the were Confused we said we were still waiting to be sat She She came back from the maze that is this restaurant told us to immediately go to the hostess desk At this point we were all excited to finally get our mediocre mass produced food until we the rest of the restaurant was up I if we had been forgotten which I was promptly told no we were just about to seat you We were the last group sat even though I know there was a attraction line behind us when we first to get our on the list I checked my phone at checked the oasis which then told me they had closed at We ordered some appetizer which took to get to our table even though we were the last At this point we were all hysterical pretty off that the incompetent staff had forgot to seat us that we were not holding back with our sarcasm of how great the food was going to be with the spit in it because we were sat after the kitchen was closed That was a melon baller size of slimy avocado my chicken we barely luke warm Needless to say that was the first last Time I I m sure my family s as well will ever visit that restaurant with a great viewThink a Dump with nice out after dealing with our waitress that like she was going to do us a favor for getting us a drink after sitting at the table for min Black attitude experience We decided to walk next door and had a delightful meal with excellent service and the same nice viewAs a native I knew better than to go here on a night and one with gorgeous weather but I was dragged by my naive who thought it would be romantic Oh boy It is anything but romantic It s actually more of a relationship test Yeah it should be where every man or woman who is considering marrying their partner goes to find out if they pass the Oasis Challenge Your first test patience You spend looking for a parking space Then you walk half a mile to the restaurant only to be directed to the next line that you up for the WAIT of which turned out to be Then the hunger You are directed to another line for the bar where you are told you can t even order chips and But you can order a watered down margarita in a plastic cup Oh you have to use the ladies room Well enjoy the line to use it and the disgusting that are filthy No toilet paper in the paper lying in a puddle of sink water I can t tell you about the food because by we were no longer hungry The one star is for the caricature artist who drew our awesome portrait and for me and my future husband making the best out of a bad situationwhat a disappointment So pretty Awesome helpful cute funny fine Then food SCARY chicken as if sitting under a heat lamp for two plus days Gross Could tell was embarrassed sad we t comment on bad food at all but she was probably embarrassed she could not remedy the Nast food situation SAD food better NOT soThe worst experience I have had in a long time Went with a large group of ladies a special occasion and our waitress from the beginning was so rude It was like she was mad she had a large table and we were her which made us all uncomfortable from the beginning She also said we t to do split at all and it had to be all on check I also work in hospitality and know for a fact that on their computer system they can split And the table behind us with people all got separate Out of all of us not person finished their plate The food was bland and extremely A manager nor out server even came back to check on us to see if we even it The only good thing any of us was the complementary chips and I could go on about how awful this place is how we were all upset but I hope you get the picture None of us will be to this place and I d advise you not to either unless you want them to ruin your specialTalk about herding people like cattle One cannot call this a dining experience It is a get in line Wait wait wait miss the sunset while you wait wait wait The food is like fast food Avoid this place Do yourself a favorWe went by recommendation from and were very disappointed without even being acknowledged Will never return and will never recommend to anyone We to speak with a manager and they were too busyNot worth the Don t be Chicken were very dry and no extra Salmon was also poorly and dry Another chicken dish was dry that my friend tried Poor service and cheap that look like for a toddler Yes the view is amazing but go to Hula Hut for x better food This was a waste of time and money Never again Can I give a no star review Get a you might be with that hereWe haven t been to the Oasis in about or and if we don t go back for that long it will be too soon Now I remember why Other than the spectacular view of the lake there is nothing to recommend this place The food is mediocre at best and the service is absolutely horrible How can it possibly take to put in a bowl bring it to the table It also took that long to bring the wrong appetizer after the correct order was a different waitress brought a one apparently not that it was already on the table It was difficult to get the check when we were ready to leave the staff more interested in cleaning empty tables Lunch for with margarita each was I think we try a different spot the next time we have out of town who want to see the lakeWow Closed at on a The hostess was rude t acknowledge my question about why they were closed and have different times she just said and hung up So much for hospitality On it they close at and the Which one is it Very disappointing like my money can be spent somewhere elseThe view is great but the food is so bad Went there today for lunch for the first time in My bill came to for a ice tea and the chicken lettuce My friend who that on a regular basis said they had really cut back on the lettuce the gave us three tiny of lettuce I for more and was for that then for a few more and when the bill came they me for The waiter t take the onion charge off my bill His response was well we charge for a side of sour cream I don t know how this place is still in business The food was bland and had no taste at all The service was bad as wellThe view is about all this restaurant to offer It s a tourist trap period The are inconsistent and the food leaves much to be desired Over the and I beg my company to view lake travis from Ranch insteadTook a friend from out of town to Oasis because it is decent and I always thought the view was enough to justify the food This trip was way different Sat us quick brought upstairs and while walking through a server t open the door for us to open it and then slowly through cutting my friend off no food in his hand just lazy s o b with an entitlement issue He turns out to be our server oh this is going to be good The girl seating us us past tables all clean us down at the dirty one and half the clean up of and dried on the table We ask to be down by the main deck and she us no those are for people and you re only people There was a party of amongst the open tables They don t have Really Rule of food service you never say no The lazy s o b that cut my friend off over and if we want something to drink We order a couple and After a while he comes over to take our order we order About go by and he comes over and if we want another beer sure we say and our With no sense of urgency or apologetic facade he oh yeah like I t put that one in The food comes after he that half ass comment The were fine no but the grilled chicken chili was to salmonella perfection We tell guy to take the and the off the bill and he does However they brought the back and if we were sure that we t want them We re sure I told my friend that he the distinction of being the last person ever to be brought to Oasis by usI try so hard to love this place It s just such a great location But on a night they schedule that take up where would normally sit to eat Dumb But then on a night where I m sure they EXPECT an hour long wait they have bartender who is seriously incompetent and several tables Staff your restaurant for the needs of your audience It s sunset time on a and they don t have every server and their mother on staff Seriously Either they don t care if they are just not paying attention I guess it s my fault for to give them a chance to fall short of my most basic of a restaurant edible preferably good food friendly service and a bartender that actually his job Come on Oasis Step it upPopular cause it s GORGEOUS to look over the edge and that s about it The service needs to be so much better I can t understand how food can suck this much The and took forever to come out Don t know how long it to milk a cow and make homemade but apparently very very very long Every time our waitress came to the table we had to order something or else we would never see her again I ordered a chicken sandwich which was moderate the were cold the chicken was rubbery and the bread was soggy Also it said it came with lettuce when by lettuce they mean of lettuce I don t understand how that would be Then when I the waitress told the manager and he never came to the table I guess they get tired running to the tables for every mistake but if they had good food maybe they t have to keep getting I wish the food the view I think the only thing they really need is A LOT more who know what they are doing and who enjoy their job Cause everyone that night a little tired not smiling and like it was a bother to run food to the tables I will be back for the view and maybe chips and and THATS allI m giving one star for the view and the atmosphere the service was bad they told us it would be a minute wait and we an hour and When I went back up to the hostess stand and how much longer would be she said the list was too long and she did not want to look through it The food came out and coldThis place an amazing view of the lake Now what you should do when you get there is take a walk over to that lake and find yourself a frog Next ask that frog to swim out find you some food prepare it and bring it back to you It crazy I know but I guarantee that frog is more capable of doing this job than the all around incompetent staff at the Oasis The Oasis is similar to The Melting Pot in a way For instance at The Melting Pot they bring you the raw for your meal and you prepare it yourself at your table At The Oasis they bring your order out cold and uncooked It is then your job to let it sit out in the sun to bring the temperature up from uncooked and disgusting to kind of hot and somehow even more disgusting The best thing this place could do would be to burn itself to the ground but they clearly can t even work a flame to even do thatI m only giving one star because the view We went there for our anniversary at a hour and a half for a table and t get our food until When our food did arrive it was cold and my husband ordered shrimp and got fish instead We were not about to wait another min for them to get his meal right Finished our drink and had to hunt down our waitress for the ticket When she finally did show up she took our ticket to go ring up and my husband told her quickly She comes back and sorry your order was wrong and that she t appreciate how she was and away I was perplexed as to why she said that so I her what she was talking about as to the way she was She had nothing to say And my husband said because I said quickly Needless to say we left no tip and will never go backWorst I have ever had We had two of One beef and one chicken No flavor whatsoever The couple we were with said the same thing about their I don t know why people waste their money here Its way over priced for a view You can get those all over were Barely any alcohol in the bloody each or the pina I have been here x and have tried to give it a chance but done now Worst food ever And service was terrible was very slow We for chips x and finally had to get them from someone else just walking by If i could give I would We will never be back The food and have never been good Where is the owner with all these bad He she probably dont even eat that disgusting frozen food Watery way Meat was tough like they buy the meat they can Put some seasoning on your food bland disgustingThis will be my ever review The Oasis flat out Poor service and incredibly pitiful horrible horrible over priced crap Period Most of the know this and that they are quite embarrassed to work here but only do because they are forced to by their My advice Scrape it and use it as a parkThe food is all frozen from my I received a dirty fork in my napkin with dried of someone else s food on it I always finish my food but I could not this time Do not recommend at all There are better ways to get a view of the lakeHow unfortunate when you find incompetent and service We drove over min to get here as we were told the view is amazing but to for the food as the quality of their food is very poor So we came with no expectation on food quality but were by the poor quality of service and incompetency of management We one hour to get a table and finally when we were ready to be seated the hostess sat us at a corner in a unventilated and very stuffy and hot area We never sat down and went back to the hostess to ask for another seat and she said we had to wait again in the waiting list She t even put us back into the list and put us at the next available seating After her decided to finally fire we sat down at another table We sat literally in the middle of other table at the only table that was open in that section As we were out what to order looking over menu the hostess came back and said sorry we need to move you We are not going to serve this table We why and she said we have no one to serve you here Yet we were in the middle of the tables that were fully seated We to speak to a manager and when this amazing gentle man up we that there is no common sense here No and no to accommodate So after a long wait and a long drive we had no choice but to go to another restaurant This is a lack of leadership and management I know these already have a really bad rating and it like no one anyways If you do decide to come here just come for the view and do not spend your money to support a business that no sense of service or management Hope this you some griefThe view is excellent The food and service is We go there every time we have out of town and we are disappointed every time They have the view So they don t care about anything elseThis is my FIRST time leaving a Yelp review and unfortunately it s because of our horrible experience at the Oasis last night Basically after our hour long wait with it was the wait of our our highly meal was far from what we in both customer service and food quality It s understandable to forget to bring a soda or accidentally forget to X the or whatnot but have I been completely not once but twice at a restaurant st the waitress forgot my resolved in a quick reminder no problem but secondly the server later with the for all except mine She somehow tried blaming her manager for not in the order but after all the delay and fuss it was more convenient to just it share with my and husband and ask for the check But THEN as we re leaving and walking back to our car the waitress frantically my daughter and I and to accuse us of not paying As she s literally swinging the receipt book in my face to show that it s empty my cash to the floor and I just had to walk away because of the embarrassment We left furious and it was just a horrible waste of time for my mother who was visiting that evening and if it t for the view I would left zeroAwesome view but poor service Food was hit and miss For such a great venue and for the it should be much much much betterWhy oh why did we waste our money on food here I ordered a MEDIUM and it and cold Our waiter was a joke I think he was high Never wrote anything down and brought out everything wrong Next time I order a soda and chips watch the beautiful sunset and go spend my money somewhere goodI agree with prior you do not come to this place for the food or the service only for the view The view is amazing but the service is horrible Our waiter was rude and not The table was dirty and we were seated in a table that we could barely move because the next table was so close to us The food was horrible as well I think just for the view you are better off coming taking a picture and heading to the nearest restaurant for actual food and serviceBy far the worst dining experience I have ever had why you should NOT eat here Terrible service Our server had a bad attitude once she took our order of a few We could tell she was upset that we t order more and she spoke to us only once afterwards regarding the check When we up to the host stand there was a very angry man to a manager about the service he had received Disgusting and over priced food We ordered a few of the brisket flat and The flat bread barely thrown together and under The was a very small portion for and tasted like and something we could thrown together for about half the price Unpleasant atmosphere The weather was amazing at the time however there were multiple at unnecessarily high blowing mist everywhere which would have been great if it was significantly hotter outside Also there were small orange that kept biting us and got all over and inside our which we assumed was because of the amount of moisture in the air from the Obviously there t much you can do about on an outside dining area but I feel as if there are precautionary that could be taken to avoid getting into our and presumably also our food The only positive aspect of this restaurant was the spectacular view We went at sunset and it unbelievable from our vantage point If I ever go there again I will not spend a dime go upstairs to the bar area and enjoy the viewGreat view Unfortunately that was all this place had to offer I m not sure how anyone can mess up in but this place We just went for a snack and drink and even the were bad I can t complain about the service Also you can keep the the water was in so that was excitingFood Service t any better But the bees constantly buzzing around the tables when one a severe allergy and being told Just stay still and they won t bother you I m sorry this was the final straw We shall not return to the land like atmosphere of the new gigantic Oasis complex what s with all the tacky Save your and find another place to catch the sunset over a lake inAlthough the were amazing the restaurant service was awful We actually never got the chance eat there First We to put our name on the list we were told it would take to get through the line already I went to the front of the line to see what was taking so long There were two with laughing about not good service and with each other I understand it t their fault about the service but it t funny Second we were told it was going to be a hour wait I was upset because we t going to eat until at that point but I understood that it was crowded and we had to wait What me the most was while waiting for at this point over an hour there were a TON I mean a TON of empty tables All different size tables too Seeing some of the standing around I went up to the host stand and spoke to who seem to be one of the He was rude and gave me attitude about the empty tables He said with an attitude I m trying to seat people I said I get that which is why I m why it s taking so long to turn tables over when you have all these empty tables I understand it was a busy night however standing around for an hour and half while there were so many empty tables was very annoying Ultimately we left after waiting an two because it was at that point and I was Later I from that the food was and not that good Glad we leftWe arrive hour wait Not that big of a deal they have a wine a tap room boot shop and various other to keep you Taproom bought a flight which had all of their on tap fantastic t get to try the wine but two fro our party had a great time in the winery We finally get to the oasis We order and The t bad average restaurant The clearly the nuclear green mix that juice So those We order and The are worse than the fully Those The are the worst I had in Not worth getting nor are they spicy like the spicy beef description On the menu This place was terrible scene was fantastic beer was fantastic service t bad but none of this made up for the quality cafeteria food that was to us for a mealHorrible service Took over an hour to get our table really Had to go to the bar to get well after we were seated Lovely view great for gullible and really drunk peopleWas Visiting did gave me a up about the lousy food It was no shock but the service was like we the wait staff an apology for dinner there If i was a local he could have an from me One star oasis Not worth itGo for the view only Service was awful Have you ever eaten at a big restaurant at a theme park like That pretty much it upTerrible service Disappointing food Inflated Horrible value Untrained and rude staff Hope you get rich off for on a school field trip Very disappointedHad such a terrible experience The food was highly but the staff was extremely RUDE There was a leaky pipe above our table and it was dropping water on our and food and the to move us Finally when we threw a tantrum they off with our food and we had to go looking around the restaurant to see where they kept it They even to replace the that got the dirty water in them Later I found a bug in my drink as well Thankfully the new waitress we got at a different section of the restaurant was nice enough to not charge me for that drink but by then we had lost our appetite and we left without eating most of our foodAs mention this amazing over Lake Travis but not much else to offer The food is not good and the two times we been here it s been cold They are as well although our waitress was friendly It may be worth a stop for a drink a peek at the view and a walk through the gift shop but there is always a wait for a table and the food t justify a waitI would say all your paying for is the view of Lake Travis Food was horrible and service was pretty awful as well I don t think we once got checked on after we got our food and before we even ordered we were told by the server that our food would most likely take an hour We almost to get sat We won t be coming back that s for sureI have been coming here for and this was my first time back since they Sell out It is very commercial with office for rent and a huge concrete parking lot Food is expensive our order was wrong and they did not bring all of the out at together Very disappointed Will not be coming back a d that my heart because I what this place used to beSeriously had the service today so we made an honest mistake we the sign to go to the bar and found a table open Very as there were a lot of entrance to the restaurant There were no sign to go to the front to be seated So we went right ahead and sat on the table in the server just kept walking past us I thought he was just busy So I let it go Then another went by He t even give us a menu Then a hostess and a couple beside us while their table was being Then I the server that kept us whispered something at the hostess and pointed a finger at us So then I m like was that all about Then the server gave the couple their while we were still being So finally my father in law stood up and went to the bar and to know why we t being Then apparently we went in the wrong way then why t they just let us know that we were supposed to be to our table I would that even more than being for The need to have refresher course on customer serviceCame here on a for a friend s going away party Got here around in line for another to valet park why Because there is a car show and even though there is a story parking structure it was full because all the car from the show took it over since they are vintage some took two We got lucky after we got valet parking BUT other guest in our party t so lucky they for to the valet and they said VALET IS FULL So the question how come we t know there is a car show Because the t no mention of it Why in the world they have a car show that took over all the parking space on a busy evening when I don t know people are here to have dinner I don t know the logic behind it Must be the thinking hey you for to park and since you are here for a party you can t leave so you are stuck here anyways And they are right I m here for the party I can t leave even though I was My friend who was hosting the party kept to us for the mess Oasis and of course we don t blame her who knew Oasis would have more than half of their parking taken over by the car show on a night Only if there is a platform that everyone someone should invent that platform and call it no no Yeah use to announce like that That s brilliant The only positive thing out of it is that we see some ladies walking up in their because the wait was so long They have really toned it was a great view So ladies get your on come to Oasis walk up the hill and be sweaty and late at your party because nothing romantic when you are sweaty That s sarcasm just in case it lost in translation Anyways the food is my chicken sandwich is dry the are Would I ever come here Only if someone my to the car seatI will never NEVER EVER go here again I went this past summer with a group of for a party I do have to admit that the view is absolutely beautiful but the food and quality of service was HORRIBLE I was a small house salad and while I was eating it a SPIDER from the bottom up and I almost accidently ate it It was TERRIFYING The waiter didnt do anything but apologize and offer another salad I didnt want to eat any of their food after that The waiter still me for my meal and when I about it a month after to complain they said they would send me a gift card or cash in the mail and I gave them my address I NEVER received anything from them Their manager lied to me I hate this place with a passion and would rather spend my time over looking lake travis from a different area The customer service is horrible and the only reason they are in business is because of the view Horrible placeWe went for dinner tonight and sat out on Beau s Porch The music and view were fantastic but the service was terribly disappointing Go for the sunset and Skip the foodover and no server How is this place still in business It was waiting for someone to take our order outside Ended just leaving we but decided to grab something to drink from the gift shop Got to the car and found stuff floating in our of lemonade If I could give negative I wouldThe view is great However go to s and take your dinner with you to to the third floor of the brewery to enjoy the view Service will be much much better price much better and view just as good Had management not automatically added a tip I would have added a to prove a point Disappointed is an easy term to useI think their catchy radio jingle and view is about the only thing this place going for it I had better food at my neighborhood Chili s and the young is like another yelper put it uninterested It s such a shame seeing this place with such potential be so cheap and by no am I talking about the price of the food I can barely remember what we ate but again I d rather go to Chili s for some and enjoy the flair on the than sit through a meal at Oasis again If s Kitchen this place I would not be and I would also attempt another go at it after an EXTREME make over of the management staff and of course the food I can t say it enough but it is such a shame the potential this place with their stellar location the potential to RAKE in the doughEmpty tables everywhere but not enough staff were out of everything and they t even serve local whiskey So disappointed in this cultural icon its th year and I was here at the beginning Won t make the trek out here again for this display of commercialismGo there for a quick drink around sunset thats about it I took a date there and I felt embarrassed to be there quite frankly Other than the view which is only worth it right around sunset nothing appealing about this place As we were waiting for a table we had a drink where the bartender thought I was if they had draft beer nope and for if they could make a margarita from scratch once again nope and they a made one from a looking milk carton You would think for each they could make a fresh one like the carpet is from a bowling alley from the garden section at Mart and the menu from a in Needless to say we left before we were even seated so I am not totally sure how the food service is from the of the other on here not that good Advice to everyone You are in the of good and pretty much every other food type Need I say moreThe view is great but that s what you re paying for Not with the service Took us to get a drink the place did not even have a wait When I finally got my drink and finished my water there was brown sludge at the bottom like a drink had just been out and they put water in not lack enthusiasm or basically any emotion at all As I m writing this I m waiting for a refill on a Pepper another Do not come here with high as I did and now I am dissatisfied and disappointedBeen there multiple times Actually got into going again I am here now View is great Long waiting to get a table Food is and over priced a I don t know anyone who comes here repeatedlyThe location was beautiful however the wait time for the restaurant was to be which turned into As we gave up and drove off to another location we simultaneously received a message YOUR TABLE IS READY Seriously it s Wonderful view Horrendous waste of time Also there needs to be a area for smoking be awareI got taken in the rear Small bowl of for There wer only of us and the a second maybe When the bill came the bowl of were each for a total of I and the waitress said that she agreed that it was too much and her manager The manager and I it and he agreed that it was too high he said that the owner up the to get ready for SERIOUSLY for tow tiny bowls of I told the manager that I was he said that they had all of to offset I told him that if that were the then the should have been Great sunset good stay away from the food or bring yourI have only been here once It was several ago and I was there with some pretty serious The were and incredibly unattractive fat people were line dancing to a cover of The Ballad of and I saw the sunset it right over the lake Somehow The Oasis to ruin it I don t know if it was the constant Dude This sunset or the The sun is setting do a shot Now this last quote is particularly perplexing considering actually getting a drink was a monumental task from the inept and non existent wait staff I can only assume those were ordered at sunrise in order to arrive on timeI been to the oasis a few times And it s mainly for the view We went there this past to celebrate my sister s graduation It was a table for I did a call ahead since they don t do Basically they tell you that they put your name down and time so when you arrive you have first priority over that t phone ahead They also tell you to get there a bit than your time and that all must be complete to be given a buzzer We had a call ahead and were all present at We were given a buzzer and told it would be about until we were seated But that it s usually only We t seated till It took to get We just ordered and water Our food order took over one hour When they finally brought it out they brought us we told them we t eat When we told our waiter we were given attitude My brother went to speak to the manger who t even come to our table and apologize for the mistake He just took off that item and nothing else They expect gratuity of and we due to the waiter being very rude The food is way Definitely not worth it I t recommend eating here Unprofessional staff andI have been living in area for and this place is historic for Great Lake Travis bad service and food I go every few to see if this place and nope Still the worst and food in If you are from out of town it s treat to visit but be There are much betterI t even get to eat here We have been waiting over The couple in front of us just picked a table with a prime view and seated themselves The were immediately chips and We were to move and ended up wandering to the upper deck oasis brewery where we ended up eating We are done full had fun and just now at almost received our text that our seat is ready no thanks Don t waste your time They apparently seat people they favor over youthis star is for the hostess wish i knew the name my husband had a tripod with his camera and he gently for the nice view of the sunset she threw the menu on the table and she said here you go what the hell she was not doing me a favor the restaurant was not that busy Food was good star for that and the service was very slow but i am not we had a plenty of time to take a of sunset my bad luck i have to go to and i with that girl again her she can t even speak sign language very bad service at the entranceHorrible service Got food before Rita s were watered down Food and Did not get silverware or til much later than we got food t get ketchup for til they were almost done with the meal Server brought wrong credit card and bill back to us Crazy bad experience Never going back for food Maybe for and viewIf I could put zero here I could Don t go here for finally got a table We were then why we were at our table We told the server we had been seated by their seater She left and after another because of no service we left We did happen to wait in line and got a drink while it And and very dirty restaurantA beautiful view over the lake them in night after night Think of this place as a bar with a great view Be it s not an inexpensive place to have a couple of DO NOT attempt to eat the food at this place I think it s in from a Bell Even the chips and how do they screw this up are pretty bad I think this is yellow tire sealant Never had a problem with the What s up with the and crap at the entranceFood is totally gross and the service A tourist trap with a monolith parking garage and some lame idea to be Gay land maybe if they had some Acapulco Divers a and maybe then it might be worth the be experience Could be the worst food and drink ever in I mean how do you screw upBeautiful view but worst service ever everything was dirty and we wait for half an hour at the table for the waitress to come and she never came so we left the place It was at the third floor where the music AwfulI once lived on Lake Travis and had dinner here two or three nights a week not because it s good but because it was close Filled with especially in Summer at sunset which is spectacular It s loud and busy and service is accordingly slow Even if you are a regular you get the feeling the wait staff is over worked and going to make their money on bulk service rather than quality The food is not bad and if you are from out of town you should visit this place at least once for the sunset and a cocktail but do yourself a favor and have your meal somewhere elseWe had a and t even use all it What does that tell you This place is a flat out joke WAY for hospital food Yes the view is great but thats it My Hamburger It LITERALLY tasted like th grade How sad is it that a place in can t make a decent My wife had the chicken lettuce wrap s I seen better iceberg lettuce in a rabbit cage at a pet store than what they us for appetizer lettuce for chicken I am not making this up Seriously I almost forgot but my wife also ordered a drink We were pretty sure it was a and it as well She t even finish it and she always her We left with an aftertaste in our mouth Both of us Seriously All in all this place should be shut down for people in the ass What a rip offCardboard like and painfully poor service The view is unbeatable which is the only reason it was star worthyI rarely write bad but this place to pull one out of me I can t complain about the distance I drove to get here although I think it does make one s higher We at the bar for the rest of our party because they won t seat incomplete which I perfectly understand I got a margarita that tasted like lime juice obviously not fresh lime and at that s just not acceptable I to say something to the bartender and he a shot of triple sec in my margarita I assume he forgot it We were seated and while our service was fine I was at the high menu I added cheese and to my and it ended up at no lie And it was a pretty mediocre I similar at my table a top comprised entirely of and Being in the restaurant industry we are generally able to forgive quite a bit so hearing this group complain was pretty serious But at the end of the meal we are told by our server that she cannot split I realize it this on the menu BUT they use and I have quite a bit of firsthand experience with this system they most certainly can split they just don t want to We had to bribe her with the promise of good if she did so Blah blah blah the view blah blah whatever It s a tourist trap and management t even care Take your money down to Salt Lick in Driftwood or to any of the other fine Please don t waste it hereI grew up in and used to hit the Oasis regularly after a day at the lake The food was always mediocre but the atmosphere was relaxed and all the quirky wood gave great of sunset over Lake Travis Sometime between the time I away and my most recent visit this place sold its soul The quirky wood fell victim to a fire but rather than rebuild better than ever they a monument to commercialism and greed that t feel out of place in or where the obvious goal is to extract as much money from you as quickly as possible while providing the worst service they can get away with Park in the sea of and pay a fee for a golf cart to drive you to the restaurant or pay a fee for valet that t go to the valet staff but rather to the company Then stand in a plastic rope line to check in at the host stand where if you are lucky they will tell you that there is an hour wait and not more While you wait you can hit the bar where there is no table staff no and no view of the lake But there is another rope line to stand in in order to get at the bar Or you can peruse the Oasis branded stuff at the large gift shop or look at for the Oasis branded wedding or visit the Oasis branded brewery Don t try to talk to the staff they are frantically rushing around to the this place about being able to seat people and thus they are generally rude and dismissive The answer is always no anyways No you can t wait at those strangely empty even though there is a wait tables No you can t stand there to watch the sunset No you can t get chips and in the bar No you can t open a tab No you can t split the check And no they don t take And the food is still mediocre at best They even have a on their menu like they re of it Seriously check their web site Who needs quality when the won t come back anywaysThis is probably the worst food and worst customer service in all of Waitress sat at our table after of waiting to order and well what do y all want The food took forever and it was just not great quality Great but not of the foodHorrible service It was suppose to be a special evening and the service and treatment was so bad I almost have to laugh a good story I was told manager did not help to fix the situation because place a wonderful view and should could have been nice Hope it works out for everyone else really doSave your money for a fast food place Flavorless food not worth the hour wait Chose a shrimp appetizer that was basically right out of the freezer with a watery base Not the right way to start off the night after waiting Then you have to wait more time to have your main dish Wait wait wait not worth the time or priceThe only thing this place going for them is the view Otherwise another owner would know this is a gold mine and provide better food and service Avoid and go to the brewery insteadThe worst food in Stay away Bad service long weak over priced and terrible stadium quality bland food The worst part of it all is how rude all the are The hostess was the girl I have ever met in Waiter was not much better Who these And yes the view is beautiful but you should just go have a drink upstairs at the tap house and go eat somewhere else Shame on you Oasis for treating people like crap and serving them over priced crapAbsolutely gorgeous view The worst service I had at a restaurant During the spent there our waiter only our table twice once to refill chips and later to take our We nearly for water when we could not find our waiter or any other willing to help So we never received a single refill until our waiter brought our at the end Our friend had left his debit card by accident and he the restaurant in order to find it Whoever the phone said no manager was available to assist in finding the card which my friend to drive to get there After he drove back no one would help him so he to walk on the deck we sat at to find our waiter A different waiter on the same floor said he knew our waiter had taken the card Once he found our waiter he said he t have it and said to look through his if he The manager said he d call after shift was over but still no callI originally posted a review of the Oasis and gave it two the second was only given because of the generous music venue and dance floor At that time I was by their person via a Yelp message to give their food drink another try A new chef and restaurant philosophy or was it sense of responsibility were supposedly responsible for an dining experience night I drove out to the Oasis to enjoy some dancing and a good show by Seth Walker I don t usually spend money out there for stated in my first review However due to personal encouragement received in a yelp message I decided to try again Bad Decision You got my money once again but only once again Thanks but no thanks Was originally told by my waitress that the only scratch would be the one that was huh I spoke to the bartender myself and he assured me that he could make a scratch margarita for The waitress this and promptly brought me a margarita on the with salt as ordered But not from scratch no not even close And with of salt in the bottom of the glass I tried their spicy chicken not The were the same as always I ordered a second drink double shot of top shelf tequila chilled and dressed I received a double shot of tequila on the Next time I just bring a flask of bourbon or not drink at all I wish I could have on review but alas everything I tried or tried to order did not work out as it should Thus The Oasis a star on my review Seth Walker the show was great thanks for thegot sick on the desert food not good at all great view too bad they can t make decent food have been there three times and to get worse each timeThe food here is bad like really really bad So bad that I had to rush home and run to the bathroom to avoid an accident kind of bad We ordered the for an appetizer and there were a few sprinkled on a mound of dry chips My was so bad I t drink it and gave it to my husband who is less picky He t like it either and t finish it The were dry and flavorless The only reason to come here is for the beautiful view and so you can take your photo I remember this place used to be good when I was younger before the original burn down All the went there before Guess it gone downhill I will never eat there againMe and my came here for lunch this The food was nothing special and the customer service is POOR The order took them before they And surprisingly the waitress t get one of our order And we have to wait for another for the next order The location is perfect but the customer service is horribleI have been going to the Oasis for over but never for the food On my last visit a few ago I never got that far We around and about in line just to get on the waiting list after struggling to even to find a parking spot by construction After being told it would be a minute wait and being directed to an inadequate bar with only the wait to about an hour So after missing the sunset and the temperature dropping into the s we were shown to a table on a newly lower deck where there was only one set of AND they were leaving because it was too cold When I where the were the seater told me those were on the upper I told her this was unacceptable and we would just take a seat inside She told me I would have to go back to the front desk and get back on the waiting list We picked up and left at that point went down to the Hill Country House and had a great experience I went to the Oasis and a complaint the next day about the experience that as a former restaurant manager I felt management should be aware of what Its been at least and I haven t a word I don t know if will ever go back because a stupid sunset will only take you so far Eventually you better be able to produce a decent dining experience to go along with itAfter being away from for about four one of the first my wife and I to do on a sunny afternoon was to have a drink relax and watch the sunset from The Oasis as we done many times before when we lived in I always The Oasis as a somewhat modest place a little away from town where you could get a decent drink and have a beautiful view of the water Everyone knew the food t the but the view and decent made it worth it When the place burned down in it was a big deal and upsetting for I remember going for a couple times after it burnt down to show support even though it was essentially just a porch the of the old Oasis and of course beautiful Lake Travis Fast forward to today I don t even know where to begin The new Oasis compound is so absurdly large that it could be seen from a plane I m sure it could probably qualify for it s own There are multiple a parking garage office space event space and what to be a hotel or some sort of lodging all in the Oasis space You enter the Oasis to be by a set of tween with like ear on and about just to handle seating After about a minute walk through the of and general gaudiness you eventually get to your seat Service is essentially non Personally if I worked there I d probably get lost just saying My wife and I only stayed for one margarita She her house margarita as it s like after you finished a good margarita and there s that lime slightly salty ice water left in the glass I will not be back You find me at Dam park tequila and watching the view of the lake from there I m well maybeVery The don t like their and just talk about the loudly at that Food is great Just horrible service Waiting on our waiter took longer than the food Our waiter was great He with all the people and since it isAs many have said the view is great As many have also said the food I t know you could pay for that t sizzling like every other place they are on a menu and the meat t grilled at all Food will never be a purchase I make or recommend to anyone going to the OasisFood is BAD Service was great are weird t get to see the view The food is not good s is better The service was good but in all honesty there were only three in the entire restaurant when we up Also we up at and they were we if they closed at and they said they just start whenever stop coming in because the restaurant is so geared around the sunset So just beware that they may be closed just because The pork stuffed are gross had some frozen from that were just as equally gross The shrimp is at best large but taste gross The chips and for large cold store bought quality chips The chicken buffalo are dry but the ranch is good The steak is good though but it s hard to mess up a steak Wish we could have seen the view but got there too late and it was dark I am sure it would have beenThis one star goes to the amazing scenic view of this place need to put on at least a fake smile We were seated outside upon request but when we went to our table nobody had up the area There was a piece of broccoli on the floor and chip all over which t bother us at first Then the waitress took forever to bring us the wrong this is where it all She had given us chips and Once we were half way done with the my wife spotted a hair in it It t just laying on the surface but the thing was sticking out from deep inside My wife had to leave the table to go puke in the bathroom We told the waitress about the incident and she just said Well we are outside So I guess that it to have in our food right Once the food was brought to us we t even bother touching it and we to see the manager We told the manager about the discovery that we made and to take our food back because we t going to eat it The manager was fine with our decision and t even courteous enough to tell us not to worry about the two that we had We wasted at least an hour and a half at this placeThe only thing saving The Oasis these days is the view If this were ANY other restaurant it would have closed long ago I now been or times and every single time the service been the same Rude aloof If you want a nice view of the sunset over Lake Travis just go and get some chips and Do not expect good service from these I really given them a chance before writing this review to ensure I felt fairly about their service and it s been the same every time awful It is a of extreme and bad management The food is mostly good It s standard fare and the house are strong If you are able to actually order oneOne of the worst costumer I ever seen wow The only good thing is the view of the lakeAs most of the previous have said the food is horrible and the service is bad too We had to ask the waiter times for something and we other tables around us eating upset because of little to no service You need to hire more staff when you know there are big going on in Yes the view is spectacular and are Management should take this into consideration even if they do make enough profit off of their and Even though its a huge tourist attraction I would think you would take enough pride into fixing the food Fish were horrible No flavor at all and shrimp as wellAverage food and slow service I definitely t recommend Great view And I understand it s cold but at the of my meal I to look at the view but the were locked I was definitely disappointed due to it being a late birthday dinner and won t be backA one time rodeo This was a terrible experience It was so bad that it is worth writing the review on the first and only visit The system does not work It does not work because apparently they have to sit people first come first serve In this case if a big group is in front of you and there is no big table available then they don t serve the smaller We for over They of course told us the wait was half the time We then to get a table and guess what No one would come to the table We had to contact the supervisor to get service The food was not even decent Only the brisket sandwich is worth trying The view is great but the overall experience is not worth the wait I cannot recommend this placeSo my group had to wait an hour and a half to be seated wait over an hour then before they close the server me that I need to the bar for a beer because he s busy I follow up on that and then the bartender me that it s closed I follow up with the same server he me downstairs and I get a similar response which I look man I get it I too and I know that you want to get out of here Still no service on this wild goose chase I walk outside to have a cigarette to calm down from the scenario and en route to walking out I see a family about the service I can t help but validate that my experience was horrible as well The response to both of us was him walking away to his system and telling his worker I don t give a about these people For such a beautiful venue it sense that the average rating was a out of If I said that the staff was below average that would be a complimentThis was absolutely the worst service and terrible food after a hour wait We would never EVER come back here The view and atmosphere is great but other than that everything was a terrible experienceI start with the great view Um that s it food Wow the most terrible food ever It Jack in the Crack seem like a star gourmet restaurant Unfortunately I have eaten here quite a few times Because of a party there or meeting up there or showing someone from out of town a great view I remember that I had and before The meat is always tough and not seasoned at all If I ever go there again it be only for meFood was decent but service was TERRIBLE We walk in put our name down and it was be a min wait We we to catch the live music Hostess said there was open seating in that area So we went Sat at a table off the for the view The table was dirty and still had on it so we for our server The server comes by us sitting there over us and only the bill left from the previous t say hi t ask if we need need nothing just us She to a table right next to me and off I t believe what just She comes back to another table near us I catch her and tell her we were a new table that wasnt our stuff and some She was snappy said it will be a minute and leaves I was furious I was walking to the front and caught a manager I told him what He said let me find you a table Didnt say sorry but ironically US TO THE SAME DAMN TABLE THAT I JUST LEFT I said hell no F that waitress F this area and went back to see hostess for the main area Had to wait to sit We go sit and our table is so wobbly it s leaning Hungry and thirsty we decide to hurry eat and get the hell out We order a chicken dish and they don t even give me a knife And the waitress t come by very often so I had to cut my chicken with my fork It was ridiculous I hate this place No one concept of service Not even the manager Absolutely terrible P S parking is tooTo give you an idea of what to expect the shrimp is made with bait shrimp The view is the only good thing at this placeAVOID THIS PLACE PLEASE The wait over priced food that is average the were dry so busy that the waiter kept forgetting our order food was below average and last but not least there s honestly NOTHING SPECIAL about this restaurant The only special thing is the view but THATS IT I would rather go to a food truck than here any dayMy sister and her came into for her party They drove to get here and after hearing all my rave about this venue I thought I would bring them here We for a seat with a view of the lake and we were brought to a table that is right outside the door and you can t even see the water We three times to move and the host I check and to go stand at the host stand and pick her We early enough to where there was no wait and we could see there were still empty tables After waiting for the host to check we had to wait another and decided to just flag down a waiter and stay where we were I worked in the restaurant industry for and know it s not that hard to move a table when We re currently at table debating if this place is even worth sticking around for Update out of four of the we ordered one of them had hair in it and one of the was extremely rare when it was ordered medium I feel bad I wasted all of their nights with such an awful experienceWe over and had to leave because we STILL t been seated Horrible wait staff no one to serve us or seat us I would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE HORRIBLE PERIODWhen you build a house on a hill you will have a wonderful view It comes natural And so it is with the Oasis And that is already the best part about The Oasis The rest simply class The in the restaurant are notoriously and people have to wait in line to get a drink There is as good as no beer on tap let alone a selection of micro The house wine comes out of a spout like for beer When you walk through the restaurant it like a huge fast food restaurant with plastic everywhere No table cloth The price for food is not on par with it s quality Now they a new entertainment area the Overlook however no additional were set up Now there s even a line in front of the men s room Besides the area cheap The message the owner of this place out is I know you have to come here if you want to enjoy a good view Come for the view and pay for food and a lousy selection of beer and wine Again this place classI haven t been here in and now I remember why Our server was attentive and took care of us completely but the food was another story The oasis outside of its exceptional view at of lake Travis food that is mediocre at best All we ordered was which was a tiny serving on a giant bed of lettuce underneath Not to mention there was a hair in our food Disappointed but not unfortunatelyHonestly from a stranger to another just save your money Even if you have the money to spend on complete ass food just save it I had a party of and none of us finished our plate This is the absolutely most restaurant ever People solely go here for the view which t even that great If you want to come here and check out said view just walk past the and go look at it maybe get a couple but that s it I don t understand how the are content with such food come out of the kitchen and still call the establishment a restaurant Without a doubt the most disappointing food i ever tasted I would not even feed it to the homelessThe food is really and truly embarrassingly bad Yes yes of course the view is nice but that was nothing to do with The Oasis I am very that they are selling nature via tasteless food I have Pick up some nice from somewhere else pack a picnic basket and just pull over somewhere nice along Trail or go to Bob park or somethingThe view is nice Now the service and the food is horrible If you want to eat good don t come here We were a group of from the moment we came in the hostess were horrible They our they t even want to be there working We even had to sit ourselves down and ended up to the manager who t seem to care much Then we sat and our server was nice but barely ever came to our table we had to keep calling him Everyone food came out cold We all ordered different salmon wrap fish It was all cold and bad None of us it Don t come here to eat come to see the view and that s it Was only able to take a pic of half a and the salmonDon t waste your money or time It took to get any food out We were of no one there at the restaurant You would expect fresh food but not here What really is that no staff ever came to us and any on what had to our food We had crying and nothing to calm them We sat there until there was tables left and still no food This is crazy The on this place were great but not today I guess you have to go on a good day for this place to be good Pick and choose your I guess Be aware and read before you get taken by that think they can do what they want to you You will pay for it in the endSave your money Skip this restaurant Food was way over priced When I the bartender why my were instead of he I guess the menu is wrong The food made my stomach hurt And the were a at best So not worth itWe just in down the road and I was this would be our go to spot From now on I will only go for a drink and chips and And the view of course The food is annoyingly bad And by that I mean crap How hard is it to cook good food They need to just not serve food if they are going to be that bad We had a chicken salad The were old and stale and the chicken was something from a package I m sure Also had the shrimp All and gross The at the front were snotty too But our server was very nice It s a shame that such a cool place would serve such crap PLEASE get a real chef and step it up Maybe then they could fill all the empty parking garage Someone skilled needs to come in and manage that place The monstrosity is there now might as well put it to good useThe only good thing about this place is the view The food is mediocre and extremely My sons food was forgotten and took for him to get his after everyone else food came out He ordered To make worse his food was cold when it finally made it to the table Server was rude and obviously t care about a decent tip Never coming back againWhen this place caught fire ago it should have burned to the ground and stayed that way It s an insult to the palate not to mention wallet and a blight on an otherwise beautiful landscape What s even worse is they re making it bigger The last and final time I went there I was totally disgusted You get food at fine dining Actually that comment is an insult to food I remember much better food at high school football than the slop they re serving up at The Oasis The thing about the place is how fancy it is It like a banquet hall with all of its cherub and and with of parking The size of the building itself is obscene It s incomprehensible that it s being expanded And then you sit down and look over the disappointing menu and receive the sickening food and realize that the joke is on you once you your tab People there are MUCH better to eat chips and that are fresh and FREE drink a margarita and watch the sunset Save your gas save your money Avoid The OasisFish s use which taste like Mudd because they buy if from China I can t believe how bad everyone s food was Nice view thoughDONT GO HERE If I could leave zero I would The view is the only decent thing about this place and that t even great at this time with the lake being so low Everything is way over priced why I don t know The should just be watered down Virgin They don t taste like alcohol and they all taste bitter and watered down I ordered the southwestern lettuce big mistake When my food came out it was cold it was suppose to have chicken in it but it was more sauce and corn than chicken and the lettuce look like they t even take time to clean it or anything like they just took a whole lettuce cut it in half and threw it on my plate Over all I was VERY disappointedI had my birthday party there and the view was the only good part of the experience The waiter was rude and inattentive and when he forgot to submit my order he like it was my fault I had to get my dinner off of my friend s plate It turns out the food is really bad too We to the manager who t do anything to remedy the problem I will NEVER go back to that placeOne only because there is no zero Thank goodness they have that s about the only thing that s good and not in their control or else they would screw that up too This place should serve HOT food to start For being a destination place with a simple menu the food should rock it instead of being rock bottom Our food took at on a afternoon and all of our were cool even the soup my wife ordered We have been here a few times and was why we haven t been still not good Go catch a sunset somewhere else facing westSitting here and it been no water which we ordered I know its a tourist trap but they expect to get tip so the service is not good another waiter to help and he said sorry thats your server pointed at a guy then continued i tell him I said we already did ago so i just ate and the food was marginal Look save your money and drive up for the photo then go some where elseFirst time last time I should have read the wait time was min to an hour for outside No problem we around to the and some time It was starting to get a little cold so we decided to change to inside We got seated right away on the second floor by the window There were plenty of tables open outside and the inside was mostly empty We about for a server and ordered everything came good food took another and this is where the really begin The enchilada with crawfish cream sauce was more like a cream cheese and spinach dip wrapped in a tortilla with shrimp and sauce on top Sadly the cream cheese was clumpy and slightly because it used to be hot maybe but it t Also no evidence of any in the enchilada just some sad shrimp a ride on top What I really want to know do they use cream cheese or is it the H E B brand The was a complete dud it came out on a semi hot skillet and there was no sizzle just meat and on a skillet might as well have been on a paper plate And finally the fish Uninspired and only memorable because the fish was also semi hot and for some reason it was loaded with chopped hot I don t like to complain about food but we the issue to the server and he t have much of a response We ate around what we could and left When we left the second floor inside and outside were nearly empty and there were still people being told min for seating This place should get out of the food business and sell that is the only appealing thing about this restaurant and they t possibly mess that up Maybe Next time I will stick to the brew pub never had a bad experience thereHorrible service group of came in and rude service from the moment we in Only to seat us at indoor tables in a corner not crowded on a at Why go here if not for the They said they put us on the patio because it would let the heat out of the building opening the although a beautiful evening at Staff was so unbelievably rude and i was actually and embarrassed as i this place to my out of country family We went down the road to a very welcoming wine kitchen and they were to have our tab and provided excellent serviceI lived in all my life and have been to The Oasis times and that been times too many Review after review go for the view not the food and rude service terrible customer service but nothing Why I read several about and he like a savvy businessman Why does the food and service not improve After a hour wait our party of was seated at round table together Really Who to sit in the middle of two round tables Our were awful and in plastic Tacky Our food was awful The were tough and old my daughter s was extremely It was bloody and cold in the middle I like my medium rare so pink t bother me but she bit into a cold raw and spit it out My other daughter s salad was watery Every single item they brought us was just bad The single reason we bother dining at The Oasis is because out of want to experience the view We obliged them up until now Never again I get that really t need to care about the quality of the food nor does it matter that the customer service is so bad People will keep coming no matter what Not me Not ever again Another thing that might be slightly petty but peeved me We were a ride on a cart from our parking spot to the front door Great I sat in the front with the driver and my husband sat in the very back We were the only people on the cart The driver my whole family so he knew we were one group I got off the cart first and I tipped the guy As we the host stand my husband told me I tipped the guy What And he took it He absolutely knew we were together So I know that s our fault for not communicating to one another but the driver should have declined the tip from my husband He should have said No sir your wife already tipped me and my husband might have given it to him anyway CreepSince I was so and so at my experience and my type A personality t handle that I my check book I the restaurant to see if there was anyway this could have been a honest mistake where our server t cheat us out of a mere five I spoke to one of the on and he said there is pretty much nothing he could do to remedy this situation because I clearly for the on the bill total I wrote and that he t prove anything that his server had pocketed the extra making her tip well over for the LACK of service she gave us I m not griping over the extra she took from myself and the other girl who split the check with me making it in tip total but this is just unprofessional at its best He would try to talk with her to jog her memory to see if she actually took the cash as her tip instead of the bill portion of the check Turns out she as cash payment instead of the so instead of it and dividing that by credit Clearly this is STEALING and while I won t dispute a mere it s enough to make me to write a follow up review on how bad this restaurant is in both service and management Thanks a lot for everything Oasis You may have the location and location and LOCATION for constant business coming in and out but at this rate you just be from internal added to the lack of supervision and professionalism from your staff Never coming backi haven t written a review on this place yet i been of times literally there s an out of town guest we go the new addition of the starlite lounge on the third floor is nice because then you don t have to actually eat at the place to still enjoy the scenery the food is atrocious and for chips and the service is terrible i guess when you have to staff a place that a thousand it s hard to find quality help and train them well my suggestion if you have to come here and you will just to see the sunset over lake travis then come here for a drink only make sure the starlite lounge t booked for the night firstThe view of Lake Travis is amazing but that s where it The food is nothing special and the are super Service t that great either I came here with some but ended up leaving and going to the Oasis Brew Company next door That place was so much better than this oneLet me start with the positive the view is absolutely The patio of the restaurant the turquoise water of Lake Travis You get to look out over the water and and enjoy the That is if you are lucky enough to be along an edge Otherwise they cram a ton of tables and in a small space turn a bunch of on to circulate the hot air That is the positive The negative Everything else We order our food with cut avocado No raw on the They come out with Pico raw onion and on the melted cheese I peel it off and move on My meal comes out Raw onion in my black Pico with the lettuce sour cream and cheese I send the bowl back so all I am left with is my chicken and I tell the server that there t suppose to be on anything he leaves Our waitress comes to check on us I m not eating I tell her the issue and she me she will check on it She comes back empty handed and me that they cook the rice in the morning with I tell her that s fine I can eat not raw She why so I notified her that in allergic to them my throat up Waitress me that I should announce it when Actually if I don t want something and order it without I should get it how I order it She leaves and delivery boy comes back raw in my black with no rice no sliced avocado I send the back and figure I will just move the out of the way Waitress comes back I tell her the issue she she look into it and away My and are now cold the are hard and cold like cardboard I am trying to eat it while the boy comes back with an overflowing cup of black on raw on top and nothing else He leaves and I stir the the raw are in it they just more on top to hide them Glad I t eat them there food is NOT worth going to the hospital for Never got my sliced avocado never got any rice NEVER saw the manager And my check They gave me a discount of not to pay for the black or cheese or lettuce Oh how nice of them I would NEVER RETURN The manager should be fired for not training the well and for not coming to talk to a customer when the food was wrong not once not twice but THREE TIMES and all the food t come out What a waste of time and money But hey the view was niceThis single star is for the view The food is by no good the local beer selection is really beer and out of the that I during my visit made their hatred for their job very apparent Won t ever go backI t here for food or I actually drank water while my ordered The problem was there was a line people deep at the bar and the self serve water jug was empty for quite a while I had to ask to have it This management needs to hire more because the they have while extremely competent can t keep up with the influx of even those who only want water I question also whether the number of people in the bar restaurant was in violation of fire code If your have to go to the in order to get water to drink you re doing it wrong Finally the lighting in the parking garage was inadequateThis place had a ridiculously nice and is nothing like the old Oasis It s more of a venue and tourist place than a chill restaurant on the lake The is completely different than the last time I went It s nice for what it is now but it s definitely not the same Oasis that I used to enjoy and I won t be going backOver priced and weak I been in cleaner in a bus station is South Service was good and the food was tasty but not at the quality one would expect for the priceOnce upon a time the Oasis mediocre food and service but a great view and a decent margarita Now the Oasis still mediocre food but the service is almost non existent It took an hour to get a refill on an iced tea and another to get the check when we finished Now that Lake Travis is so low even the view is not what it once was If I want to go look at the sad empty pond that was once a beautiful lake I d rather go to Ranch Blue or and where I can have reliable service and good food The Oasis just become a tourist trap but I won t be taking any of my out of town thereHonestly speaking from the very step into the main door to the whole time being at the restaurant SERVICE hostess if you are not happy with the job stay home please you are not doing us a favor very rude attitude food was I for to my waiter twice never got it ask for water never got itThe worst restaurant ever bad customer service bad food and their and not clean I swear when I ate from there I hadI won t recommend it for a family as the quality of service and food was quite bad My smelled stale and the response from the team which seating was really horrible I got a seat in my try which still t as per my choice For the other times they real poor with no space and view Chicken were really bad and I had to leave the whole plate as it tasted and smelled bad The only star is for the garden and which my wifeAnother terrible meal at the Oasis I really don t understand why come here The brewery is great but the restaurant is just terrible quality food Plus there are basically water AvoidParking lot was half full when we up but yet they gave us a hour wait period because the kitchen t want to serve large we had a party of There were multiple tables open on the inside while we The bartender on the inside bar was extremely disrespectful and away to a member of our party when she to ask him a question The food to two ago was extremely basic and the menu selection was scarce I would only recommend going for and entertainment Definitely not worth going for dining in it would be a disappointmentAre you me This place is a joke The good The view is epic The bad The price food and t good at all With a view like that I can t believe how terrible the food was One single lone star Representative of how terrible is with foodI sum it up in NOT WORTH IT Last Sat night I went up to their lounge on the floor The band was awesome I had fun dancing Everything else pretty much My friend and I ordered the and could barely eat them for a weak margarita They gave us a brownie sundae for my friend s birthday and it tasted like sand I can t believe they charge such high for crap food If you want good food and a view go to Hula HutLong wait for terrible food over worked staff that s too busy to get to the customer however nice view of lake don t be when they advertise a band is there it is not true You can t hear the music from the restaurant music is up in the next buildingThis place is terrible but specially around the I took my family who drove to see me to Oasis and I was totally embarrassed by the service food and the god damn hostess attitude We when arrive for a seat with a view she told us they have some She took us to this corner table in the by the edge and said that s it It was big enough for person and maybe a We had four We if we can look elsewhere and she giving attitude All other hostess with people already what s available so we if we can sit at the person table She told we can t and we are not allow to go downstairs where there are tables empty As soon we we sat down at this table with no view all other hostess walking people down for the tables with view Whatever she no sense so be it Then we got our waitress who was clearly high on When her stuff she will response late We for drink never came Chips refill nothing Even we and no she t busy She will look at us and walk by us many times with the stuff we need and still can t remember that we The chicken sandwich was cold The was tasteless I left totally embarrassed with the type of service They had a sign interview hire immediately the type of people they hire and the food don t justify the view And certainly not worth a lunch bill with a high on drug no service waitress Seriously you can go to the side of the restaurant and snap a picture for free then just run It is not worth it over rated This place needs new management or sooner or late it will shut downWe are sitting at the Oasis right now and have been waiting for and they re telling us it s going to be another I could understand the wait if the food t suck so bad but this is ridiculousOver an hour wait for lunch A ton of open tables all over the place This always me off Waiting for so long and seeing open with no one seated If you are short staffed then close off other we can t see Then we had Slow service and just food Such promise such a huge let down Never coming backfood is not good and the wait is long during peak Save the tripThis is NOT a place for a nice dinner Bad customer service and sub par food The only reason to return is for the view of Lake Travis I was unsatisfiedWas in a party of about of us ordered the Shrimp After everyone had received and finished their we where the of shrimp were The waiter gave us this lame response that the kitchen was very busy Not my problem I am paying good money so lame are unacceptable later are The meal is cold We sent the meal back and tell them not to bother with a new meal since everyone else was finished later the manager comes out with of shrimp and they are on the house These are just as cold and like the same cold from before Pathetic service and poor food The ONLY nice thing was the view of the lake Do not waste your time coming to this place Huge disappointmentMy wife been talking about taking me to the Oasis for as we only visit family in every couple of I can t review food because we never got seated We where told min to seat hour later we where told more min due to people hanging out to watch the sunset Why where we not told that we should expect to be sat after sunset an hour ago when we checked in The knew that but the guy us in t in So my Their timing we would have been sat at they close at so to the bar They say on the they are known for their we get to the bar and ask for a frozen strawberry margarita with silver Nope all frozen are out of a machine they do not do silver patron and no flavor for frozen Last they t offer on tap beer or but no list of local beer just a stack of on a shelf above the bar hard to see from the line to get to the bar Not a good time no sunset and no margarita could have gone to for thatThe reason I made this account on Yelp was because of this restaurant The restaurant was beautiful too bad the service and food t match its Went with a party of since we were traveling from they made us wait about to get seated by then we knew what we took about to an hour for our food to come out and when it finally did it was cold Besides it being cold my plate was so upsetting I t get to eat comfortably I ordered shrimp comes with colossal shrimp wrapped in bacon and sides Only ate the shrimp they were regular size The sides was rice and grilled which tasted awful I t even eat it I was a delicious and good looking plate since it was more than Finally when check came my plate alone was over due to and gratuity I even told the manager and he did nothing about it I for shrimp go figure At least the scene was nice but NEVER AGAIN Make sure you eat before going and use the restaurant just to take and the beautiful sceneThe view is absolutely spectacular of Lake Travis BUT the food is terrible Just go for the and the gorgeous sunset First the service was so off that I the hostess TWICE to get an ice tea for the two of us I watched several drag the tray of food into the on the balcony The floor on the was quite dirty and when a server a whole tray they t even clean it all up My were down the worst I ever eaten The tasted old and from a plastic package and they tried to cover up the fact that there were only maybe pinto weird right on my bean and cheese The white cheese was plastic tasting I tried to just eat the chips because I was seriously hungry waiting an hour and a half Go for the view it s worth it and eat beforehandEverybody in you only go here for and to enjoy the Lake Travis and the beautiful over the water The last time I was here I if it was even worth the visit just for the The entire place is always like a ghost town and there are not even enough good there to get a decent glass of wine or even any decent beer worth drinking to make me want to bring my out of town and hereThis place is terrible We been here almost two and were finally mediocre food three of four were wrong not the way we ordered Nothing tasted good Imitation cheese on the and carpet are disgustingly dirty Service is poor The only good thing is the view over Lake Travis would have a better meal We won t be backstar for view literally everything else about this place was awful The place was filthy The look like they haven t been in days Several tables around us sat the entire time we were there t try the food but based on the cleanliness I t have to The is incredibly cheesy and off Betty bronze this an identity crisis Overall I would not recommend it It s a shame because the location potential This business should reach out to The Profit for helpWe t been to the Oasis in a couple of since we were in the neighborhood yesterday afternoon we decide to stop and have lunch We in the lobby at After being sat at a table with a wonderful view we for service Then we for longer After without so much as a hello or we be with you shortly we go up to leave On the way out a manager stopped and us the issue and he to seat us in a different section I said why t we seated somewhere else to begin with worked in the restaurant industry for more than in my youth I am very familiar with the industry The manager did nothing to address our The restaurant was not busy We will never go back and will never again recommend to anyoneFood is mediocre at best Go for the view and don t recommend eating thereThe view is but otherwise there are a lot better in for local We at the Starlight Terrace just before the at We were able to get a table for our party of very easily as they were not full About we were finally able to flag down a waiter to request some water He brought chips later and said he would be right back with We did not get any until we him two more times and that was brought to the table at about That level of service was pretty much what we got the rest of the night We ordered food at and the food did not arrive at our table until after getting up searching down the waiter and him several times what the problem to be The waiter kept telling us they were just really busy This was a evening and I would suspect no more busy than typical Even worse two of the ordered were stone cold The waiter never stopped at the table to ask if we anything The manager did come to the table at one point to say the food would be ready momentarily we d to cancel our order but it was still another And unbelievably the waiter or management on a gratuity I would definitely not recommend the Oasis unless you really just want a place to view the lakeExcept for the stellar view The Oasis would get zero from me How bad is it Let s start with their Perfect Margarita It was perfect alright perfectly awful Insipid weak watered down made with cheap tequila and bar mix For eight Most self respecting that sell Perfect make them from scratch with real and they taste like it I to our waiter about the margarita and to his credit he said he would get me another one When he returned he said that he had added some Grand to it And indeed he did He added Grand to an insipid watered down pitiful drink The food It is and made from Take the chili stuffed with pork that I ordered Actually they originally me with a chicken dish that I t ordered When they finally brought the it was obvious from the taste and appearance that they had been prepared by some off vendor frozen and to the restaurant The only thing that the kitchen did was heat it up and flop it on a plate with poorly seasoned and flavorless rice My recommendation Drive a bit further down and go to the Grille The view t as spectacular but the food and are better and less expensiveI went to the Oasis against my better judgment for lunch because my grandmother it Summary The view was gorgeous the service tolerable and the gluten free experience terrible The menu both the one handed to me at the restaurant and the one posted on it for which are gluten free When I the menu I that several of these also have a Shiner Bock beer next to them which would seem to indicate they t actually gluten free Bad sign So I decided on the cheese to avoid all of the meat The server then that the corn t gluten free because they are made in a facility that also wheat and I look at the more current gluten free menu instead Apparently the menu they gave me is old and not accurate for Um that s helpful print yourself a new menu if you are aware your current one inaccurate information on it The server eventually brought back a and it in front of me It did not appear that many full menu were on that menu I saw a few menu and the Shrimp which he I wish I d been able to spend more time looking at it but at this point I d already everyone else s meal by a solid I t see any meat other than the shrimp I the server repeatedly about the shrimp dish because it was NOT marked gluten free on the full menu but he assured me that it was what I should get Feeling exceedingly nervous but not wanting to make a further scene and further delay everyone else s food I ordered it The result I got sick Long story short if you re gluten free due to Celiac disease other medical or don t want to worry about how much gluten is actually in your supposedly gluten free food get a cocktail and enjoy the view but eat elsewhereVery bad experience visiting this place with my After of waiting we received a message only few tables in front of you guess what we had to wait another after that Finally on the way to the table there is a bunch of with a nice view Guess where are we heading To the very corner near the kitchen door with a very limited view Why Apparently this is your spot so your won t distract anybody Finally ordered and dinner very hungry after more than an hour are just walking pass us with lots of food Guess when we finally got our food Never After of waiting with hungry and upset we had to leave Almost two of waiting For what We received sorry for you poor experience well don t be because I am paying you back with the review you deserve ThanksThis place is the reason there should be a ZERO star rating For all my in I been disappointed that this place is so well AWFUL It s such a great location Yet the food is inedible it s always dirty it s expensive and the are in constant disrepair I really hope someone this place and us a great place to watch the sunset inI over to even get a drink can t say that any view is worth thatWhat a terrible experience We were our anniversary and I thought the sunset would be great What a mistake We then got seated with an obnoxious fan blowing needlessly on us It was a cattle call No personal service better at Sonic We left without an order We are that will not returnOne of the top worst I ever had The brisket sandwich was awful Tiny chopped of beef fat with a sliced pickle and Inedible Good thing they have a view I m sure it s the only thing keeping them openThis place is good for one thing and one thing only not being at your table so you can see the sunset Being at your table will only bring heartache mediocre food and an excessive bill It won t even bring you chips and from what I experienced Just badI the this week amazing view of Lake Travis We order and they were alright but the food that we order been the worst food that i for Order shrimp half avocado around of tomato and some green liquid that i assume it was that basically is and bunch of dried A house salad with horrible vinaigrette I had to for different and none of those were right It s sad to see a perfect location restaurant with such a mediocre menuThis place obviously a star for their view but when it comes to everything else they ABSOLUTELY SUCK The food like a cafeteria and the service i receive is usually mediocre or just flat out bad I given this place multiple over the because I love the location obviously as does everyone else but I just refuse to pay that much for terrible food serviceTerrible service half our party s food never came Never checked in with us about it or to see if we more the food that came was terrible a mess The view is great but that s allThe only about our visit were the sunset and the kind manager who put up an umbrella to keep us from going blind prior to the sunset Our waiter was terrible Our were often empty we sat there with empty chip My fish came out with hair on it when it came back out they had rice on my plate I had specifically said no rice double I t want to wait again so I said fine just bring me more Not only did they not me for the fish with hair they me for the extra I will never go back The food was passable at best Nothing good about the experience aside from the companyHorrible Food we ordered the Shrimp and it like frozen shrimp from a bag and tasted bland The were thrown together watery with no spice and a sad representation for a appetizer We also ordered beef for one The were on a sizzling skillet however the meat t sizzling and t taste The meat was flavorless and also HUGE disappointment It also included rice and and a bowl with sour cream lettuce a teaspoon of and frozen CHEESE The rice was mushy like oatmeal and the were The flour were not warmed and like they took them out of the package and into the microwave for a minute All in all we on a horrible dinner which we an hour and half with a total with tip it s not the waitress fault The Oasis horrible food We will NOT be going back at least for food and Cabana would have been a better choice For the Oasis need to get a new chef or update the menuVery rude and unprofessional staff up for new year no one four consecutive days before I to staff that they should really add that to their service if they t going to answer their Instead of and wishing us a good night they were very rude to me I will not be back this is the third poor experience I had with the people here Oasis really fallen off disappointing the people t classy because the venue is neatManagement there is horrible We to see if we could pay a personal check because I left my wallet at home and my wife had her checkbook with her The young lady who the phone t know if we could and told us to hold on while she went to ask After about three of holding she said that they can take our check So I told my brother his wife and son that I would treat them to a beautiful view and some good food After eating the wait staff told us that they could not take our check We told her about the conversation that we had with the person who the phone before she went to go get the manager This is what this jerk told us we don t take personal we never have and we never will My staff been working for me for over two and they would never told you that I him So are you calling me a liar He said very sarcastically I t say that Did you hear those come out of my mouth This guy ruined our night There was no reason to be so rudeLower than Just nothing It is the worst place I for an hour and a half to two different about sitting outside and was and made to wait while all the tables were completely empty Usually i love coming to the oasis every time i visit but this time was the worst experience of my dining life this place EXCEPT for our server who made it happen for us regardless of the two who said a cutter story He kept it real promote ahead of P s this placeIf I could give this establishment zero I would do it in a heartbeat been to many coastal and at with wonderful scenic this place was a total rip off and a poor job indeed I only came here because my friend s party dinner was here and I already had a bad feeling based on many of the other yelper s This is going to be a long rant on the poor service received at this location I m sorry but dining here is totally not worth it We went on a night around and got seated in about or so The server quickly us around to another part of the restaurant for some unknown reason and sat us down there though the the move was probably made so we can accommodate her section I don t know if she was a bad day or not but she took her frustration out on the whole group as she t hide her attitude or I don t care about tone of voice throughout the whole time The food was alright I t pay that much for something that tasted like dry meat made with the material in the world So here it goes Maybe I m just used to better service but I to take the tray out of my server s hand and beat her with it Yes I remember your name at least that s what it on my receipt was my blonde and terrible server With eight who are just trying to eat we t even high maintenance and we ordered moderately priced no alcohol because we were going to go somewhere else later she was sure rude I don t understand why have this feeling of entitlement also I know we are paying for the experience the lake hence the food but you don t have to outright display your animosity towards us during the whole meal Our were not once and while she made multiple going back and forth for who ta da spent money on ALCOHOL your bill is higher she made no eye contact whatsoever She brought out the check and while we were trying to split it made an impatient grunt REALLY Go back a few ago where YOU applied for this job YOU got this job and this is YOUR JOB Suck it up and WORK This is why some while location and advertising do a great job food wise no comment service just potential away Our check was gratuity split amongst three After since we the for and that included the gratuity already While I was trying to explain how we it split she left halfway before I finished speaking without even me We gave in cash and to split the rest of the bill in half each of the other two My check came back and I saw included gratuity of Sure WHAT I don t know how would also ADD another tip of from my credit card and the other girl who used her card As my experience before as a server I was terribly suspicious but the were in a hurry and I t complain I scribbled as the total on the card but surprise surprise my bank statement today being I know it s not such big money as I do spend MUCH MORE at other it just me that the people here would blatantly rip off little money at a time and that is just wrong DON T GO Scenic view is totally not worth the service and food hereFood is horrible to say the least and are extremely high Service is very slow and the waiting staff don t seem to care much We have been to Oasis a few times in the past decade and each time the food been really bad At least they are predictable with their performance We saw some who were leaving a wedding party and they were all about the tasteless food It me that with such a huge investment in this restaurant property how can the management continue to read these horrible and not do anything about it That clearly a lot about the management at Oasis Save your money and appetite Go somewhere else insteadZero really Take your sunset picture and leave We sat and over an hour for our food We watched as tables who were seated after us get the same food we ordered After about an hour the waitress who only came by twice told us that our order would be out in a minute later we left without eating At least we got a couple good sunsetTourist trap RUN Save your money Run run run Don t do it Don t do it Food Their comes out of a jar They got on your food and they don t care Rude as heck If you go Just go for the view Don t waste your money Don t waste your moneyDecent tasting and a great view and surrounding area The service I for no cheese or sour cream on my entree and received cheese and sour cream I for corn but received flour This place needs to train their they seem incompetent to meDisappointed by this land mark Didnt have a full bar didnt really have any sea food Over priced nothing special about it and just a small portion of Good for tourist bad forBell level of cuisine Go for the view but get food before or afterWhen we in the were their own personal conversation while we to be seated Once we were finally seated we got to check out their menu and at no fault of theirs the horrible view of lake Travis for we watched walk around us without even to take our drink order Sad to say this t the first bad experience at the Oasis so we did something we never done out Never againWe usually come to the Oasis whenever we have Out of town guest since it such a nice view to look at the lake and all Food is mediocre could be better for the price your paying Now service is a different story our waitress today was completely rude maybe someone her off or something but it t professional at all she had this nasty tone in her voice that was not nice at all Everyone could sense it maybe not her though she is even lucky we tipped her But this t the first time our waitress waiter was rude to us we to give them another shot but turns out we probably won t be coming back for a whileExtremely disappointed The Oasis turned back to its dive bar I guess Thankfully the view is still great I been coming here for over try to stop by whenever I m on the west side of and have time Today was the worst experience I ever had here Over of the seating was closed because they did not have the staff We almost an hour for a table and then over another hour to get our lunch PLEASE SOMEONE TAKE OVER MANAGEMENT I love this place and hate to see it so poorlyI have had some bad Bloody Mary s in my lifetime but the Bloody Mary I had here was the worst Bloody Mary I have ever had Super disappointedWe love the atmosphere and beautiful view for sure but help Oasis The staff is rude and the food is so boring and This could be a place we would wait to sit at but not for bad food staff that can barely drift to your table once a dinnerI m writing this from my table This is the absolute worst restaurant ever The water came out in a take home cup and the outside of the cup was DIRTY It took about for a waiter to even come to the table When he he was impatient and so unprofessional I haven t ordered food yet but I can say with confidence that it is not looking good Please don t waste your time The view is also not worth it Just go to insteadSo I just had a server at oasis back yard watching this amazing band and our server can t split a check and it s on the menu which he immediately took away amazing band wanting an explanation on the not so good service and ending result of this server Oasis true or not Also he grat me for the whole table Oh man talk about a good night going south by bad serviceSimple request for side at order time was ignore and again when I while meal was I was brought foil wrapped half way through the meal after the third requestIncredible view but the rest food service are horrible We came at on and the occupancy was approximately of the tables We had to wait min because they are very busy despite the majority of tables being empty I for high for our y and min late I had to repeat this request before they found high The limited menu greasy food in plastic this is what to expect for the price that you would see at upscale restaurant The only reason to come here is for the view forget the food and ignorant and their managerNope Nope Nope I realize it s Memorial Day weekend but after waiting happily and patiently wandering around for about we were past of empty tables to be sat Then Out of no chef but I presume and are roughly comprised of the same Can t do a chicken breast sandwich will have to charge for the fish to blacken the chicken Still waiting for the food we settled on at Will have to update on that Should stayed at the adjacent bar Would been much more satisfied with beer pie and a better view lived here for this will complete the first and last time I visit here Glad I t rush here sooner Update we ended up leaving after waiting more than an hour for the few we did order after watching the large table beside us who sat after us get their food They at least the meal after we got up to ask to speak to a manager our server to have written us off and it up for us Upon opening it up at home the order was incorrect soggy and unremarkable That being said the other surrounding The Oasis are all just as scenic and offer a much better experienceI start with the positive Great view I ahead and if they had a Gluten Free Menu which they told me they did Turns out all the meat is marinated in cheap soy sauce wheat I if they could just not marinade some chicken or ground beef Turns out everything is made all they do there is cook it We ended up and cheese The were bland and the cheese was on the cold side so my guess is that they just reheat them The had hardly any cheese on them and it was all in one corner The were It s worth a visit one for the view next time we try Uncle Billy sBeyond bad from beginning to end The family and I came to enjoy the much about Oasis Bar and Grill From the moment we up to this establishment we rude service The hostess forced us to sit up on the floor if we to eat because there was a hour wait As we proceed up to the floor being our first time here there are no host or anything We later figured out the floor is a bar type open seating type area before we actually flag down a waitress to take out by said they don t know who is waiting on our section and We will go find them Ordered a beer Rita for and pretty much they tipped over my beer into a margarita glass No frozen mix what so ever We to order and THEY ARE OUT OF But you can order chips and chicken came out cold and are stale They only thing this place going for them is a viewLiterally the worst food I ever had in are better Wait even are better This food was horrible It was Go to see the view and shop But do not eat here We for to get seated for horrible service and food I d never recommend for anyone to go here The was out of a jar the watered down awful and badI got to say the view is amazing but seriously they should fire that clone waiter He s rude and did not send anybody as he when I him to ask for additional sauce for my steak I had to wait long for a waitress to pass by Otherwise great placeFood is and bad Got some sort of a salad with this ugly green stuff on it What the heck was that I have not seen such a bad dish since I a family reunion and had to sample aunt s food Seriously this place is a horrible choice The only thing it going for it is the view The is so strange and gaudy that it turns your stomach Give a few million to someone with no sense of class or taste and you get the Oasis A metal concrete or the near the parking lot Just an acid trip of an experience or should I say a I don t bring out of town there any more and were better offOh Oasis You tempt me with your gorgeous you re the perfect place to take when they are making a visit to but you had to go and destroy it all with flavorless food and slushyA party of of us came to enjoy the sunset and food after rave from family in the area have gotten food poisoning which we are assuming came from the we Two immediately after the restaurant one the next day and the remainder around after the visit beautiful place but t worth cutting our trip short due to being deathly ill in the bathroom with nausea vomiting diarrhea fever and The restaurant been notified Visit was chicken chickenPlace was a dish everywhere and even in our food was so bland and were super sweet and made with a ton of artificial mix syrup On the plus side we had an amazing server That one starFor such a beautiful location this was the worst service I have ever received It take a a lot out of me to a negative review but Jenna was the worst waitress to us Her other tables were getting top service while we received horrible service We ask her about getting chips and she by saying I have three other tables We were there to celebrate a birthday but that t happenThis place and of potential I can see why people enjoy it As soon as you walk in on a evening you immediately feel chaos screaming and running around everywhere and a hostess whispering tables are in front of you It like this place can t handle it s own game I m sitting in the bar currently and I never seen a wrap around line just to order a drink A bar is typically a fun setting but this rigid like an assembly line of people Get to the front of the line order your drink pay drink Wait again to order another drink I never experienced a system like this It s overwhelming and I have a headacheThis place is the place on earth a hour for chips a hour to get our and currently waiting another to get our check This place is a disappointmentI wish I could rate the food lower than a one As bad as itFood was awful We were able to watch the sunset but honestly our hotel room sunset was just as amazing Spend your time at another bar or restaurant on the waterThis was by far one of the worst I have had in The Oasis is akin to a theme restaurant in my book I mean they server all in Oasis that you get to take home The bar ONE kind of tequila and the are nothing but a syrupy yellow mess I thought a cheesy place like this would at the very least do food like well I was mistaken What came out like a plate of dog food and t taste much better I guess when you are landlocked the sunset on the lake is appealing but when you live on the coast in it s just not that impressive I did find the random monkey entertaining but only because I LOVE I cannot imagine ever to visit this place againManagement very rude man that t care about his Won t be This place is trashthis place for the beautiful My and I came here on a night around and were seated within a few almost The girl our name but took the wrong person He was definitely behind us in line and was not a party of After I let them know this they seated us quickly Apparently the are only from the outside which I t aware of We sat inside at a window with a view The view was of the people outside and all the table blocking the lake view So there was no view I almost to be sat outside but saw that there were so many out there that it t have been a nice quite dinner at all The food was blah and there t many at all The come in plastic I the place was filled with large it is not a place for a romantic night outThe current manager the local police on that have been drinking DONT GO if you plan on a coupleLimited menu food was cold Only nice thing was the view was cold too Service was not good Wait staff was Chips and were goodAs always terrible food terrible service and excellent sunsetIt off good but when tried to send back steak for not being as ordered Manager came to the table and was down right rude for no reason I was how poorly our out of town family was This restaurant is from our house but we will take our business and our sunset somewhere elseWhenever someone dinner at The Oasis my first response is usually Oh Are y all doing anything afterwards And that s NEVER a good sign While I enjoy looking at the sunset as much as the next person I struggle to call this a restaurant sometimes because not only is the menu uninspiring I actually find it shocking that they can screw up something as simple as an order of The problem with the Oasis is that they re really only good at selling one thing the sunset When it comes to that actually matter the food the service you might be better off at Chili s If this restaurant was in the middle of town I d only give it a few I won t waste your time in writing about my experience Frankly I d much rather just completely block it out of my mind But come here if you want to check out the beautiful sunset over the lake If I absolutely had to come back I d Make someone else drive Make whoever got me to come here to buy me a few you re need a few its pretty watered down Get Order the and only the and wait for the sun to go down so I can go get some real foodOur past experience was horrible so we haven t come back in We have visiting from out of state so we to take them to a place with a beautiful lake view We hoped that the food and service had since they the place Unfortunately nothing We got the worst service and the food was disgusting Our waiter took forever to take our order the food took forever and he never came back to fill our water glasses We were a party of and small I guess he figured he was already getting his commission based on the size of our party so there was no need to work for it Knowing how bad our past experience was with the food we all decided on it was a safe choice Our waiter informed us that they were all out of Who out of Especially when it s one of the main on the menu He was totally unapologetic about it too Totally for the quality of food we received and none of us finished what we ordered Total disappointment and embarrassing to bring here I would only recommend this place for the view of the lake and maybe an drink Stay away from the foodGorgeous restaurant horrible customer service and management Don t recommend coming back more than onceOne star only because the view is beautiful Food is terrible and service is worst that terribleExpensive and tasteless food I initially thought its an authentic My with food and They don t know how to make a goodOur experience was so disappointing The waitress did not bring the food that we ordered Never brought us water or checked on us She oil all over the table and it ruined my dress She said nothing when I it The margarita was and in a small plastic cup with zero presentation The chicken finally and were delicious There were tables everywhere unoccupied yet they to put us on the third floor I will never recommend this place So disappointedEating at this restaurant was one of the worst of my life From a two hour long wait to straight up rude service to waiting for dinner this place is a disaster We at seven and had still not been by The food once we were finally was mediocre at best I know there are many people who feel it is for the experience and view but in my opinion there are better to see a sunset where you won t be like cattleFood is rubbish are mediocre View is Pick your poison Yelp won t let me post this unless it s longer but you get the ideaTerrible food and service Food was bland Server kept on forgetting Only thing good about this place is the viewup at on a sunny afternoon We were seated and then we and and and and and and finally we got fed up and left and went down the road to Lucy s Chicken who had better food and a good happy hour too We used to love this place before it burned down but now it s just nothing but a place to watch the sunset SadI absolutely could NOT wait to write this review I wish nothing short of a quick painful demise of this horrid excuse for a Tourist Trap Hey read any of my previous and I will go in to pleasurable depth all our The good the bad and the ugly This place nothing short of demise I tried to give but alas there are that even Yelp can t help me get past in fact you can t give negative either In fairness my here is directed in one single solitary direction the scrawny manager his industrial half way down his scrawny figure with his block of a talkie helping to enhance his importance figure Enough let s get to the up yesterday with of ours who have travelled some to experience true hospitality and flavor Although the Oasis t exactly true flavor we thought we knew it as true hospitality BAH to that The place was almost entirely deserted at the arrival time We did the self tour with our who were by the and of the food being to the sparsely crowded place Being that this is a tourist trap with over rated under valued and over priced food I we get some chips n and just take in the for a short while before heading out for a more suitable dinner We made our way back down to the front desk and this is where we meet Scrawny I think I m important because I wear a talkie and my tag Manager Punk spoke to us in his hood lingo and spoke LOUD did we look older than No one in our party was doing sign language and no one in our party was reading We your hood lingo quite easily so tone it down next time We that we our from VERY far away out of town to have a short continued experience at the Oasis by a table for some Chips n Well Scrawny went in to some hood lingo laced rant about how he had a hour wait they were really really busy and t allow us a table for just Chips n and Wait just a minute Who the said anything about For all Scrawny knew which is actually true our are quite the experienced wine and had fully on indulging in some local while down on some chips n FURTHERMORE had the chips n been a BIG hit the menu and surrounding could have scrapping our evening s dinner for the Oasis our party of could made it a far more worthy opportunity for the Oasis But no Scrawny to repeat several times how he could not provide us with a table in his BUSY hour wait joint for just chips n n and that we could out in the lounge Well Scrawny you and the rest of the there whom I m guessing are mostly college to earn a few while struggling through school This group of new to the hospitality were at your attitude and demeanor However one thing is clear they KNOW this t the norm for our area And it is our pleasure to let you know we hope your demise is forthcoming Happy and Happy New Year to YOU P Bon EVERYWHERE else but hereNot worth the time or the money Bug in my drink food was not hot warm beer Service was slow and very mediocre Management t seem to care since they have so manyI an event that was the Oasis as a venue The space was nice and of course it that fantastic watch the sunset over Lake Travis location but no one is the food is f ing terrible Yes the food was so bad it drove me to We were pork loin something to be saffron rice and black I am not a terribly picky eater and I will eat most especially when I am very hungry which I was I t had a chance to eat all day but I took one bite of the pork and promptly discreetly spit it out into my cocktail napkin this was a classy function I t just vomit onto my plate I can t even describe the taste it was awful I manage to choke down the rice which had that horrible freezer burn taste and the extremely bland black How could a restaurant serve food like this If I was the owner of the Oasis I would be embarrassed by the crap that was coming out of my kitchen So I to get insanely drunk on their and vodka I guess I can ultimately thank the Oasis for giving me inedible food because it only took three to throw me on the floor If you are dying to see the sunset on Lake Travis skip the Oasis and head over to Uncle Billy s Brew better food and they have about of their own on tapWe had been Oasis it s away is friendly basic bar food and the are fine if they come from a bottle or tap The t bad but you re the patio and the view Also great to bring out of town for the view always with a warning that the food t great and skip the and So Mother s Day weekend we go for dinner on night with a guest The of us eat and have watching a cover band Not bad though the service was as terribly slow as ever We get home settle in then realize as we re headed to bed that my wife s is gone She she left it on the table so we call No answer they re closed She up the locator and sure enough it s at the Oasis though they been closed for an hour While she s upset and headed out of town on business shortly we figure no problem we pick it up at open Come the next morning before the Oasis it s no longer showing up on the She goes over at open and is told that no was found She that it was showing on the Find My an hour after they closed and some comment about people being dishonest We then wait a week for it to maybe show up before a new one You know who s dishonest YOUR THIEVING The next night I start feeling sick days later I m in urgent care the cause food poisoning from night The doctor at the urgent care even it bad hamburger meat eaten late When he where I ate he just shook his head as if I should have know better You know who won t be dropping way too much on terrible food and slow service by petty at least once a week ME AND EVERY GUEST I TAKE OR PERSON ON THE STREET I CAN SHARE MY STORY WITHThe restaurant closed before I was even notified about my reservation Beautiful go someplace else to eatThe food is average sat down at my table and was not on for or acknowledged for Service was very disappointing but the view of Lake Travis is beautifulWhere should I start Let me just say it was the worst experience ever in such a famous restaurant I m definitely not coming back And regret of every penny I spent Oasis on a till I get there at p waiting for we re a birthday party to my The waiter comes to me and that around p the kitchen will close Tell me why the hell at the waiter comes back again if we re ready to order cause the kitchen in min SO p the kitchen but he told me it would close around and the of operation are A TILL No problem Half of the people to go over there to celebrate the party was hungry and after leaving there we had to go to another restaurant so everyone could actually have a dinner After that the rest of the crew sweeping around or table before p We re there trying to have fun even without food and we can t really walk around the table or anything because there is people already sweeping and standing in our way Fine As we re getting our stuff ready to get out of there with all looking at us with ugly face because was already we have to deal with a rude lady that was basically yelling at us Can you give me the dirty Hey can you pass me the dirty REALLY Its not like we brought just a few people to spend money there We brought people Everyone unsatisfied with the service on a night You just gave your back to us while we tried to spend more money over there Frustration Regret You should change your of operation and add a notice at the end We close the kitchen even before you think about Hope the management can fix that to don t have anyone else like we wereNo thanks View It s a tourist trap and that is all Have a drink skip the food blahFabulous Horrible food bad service and lousy My recommendation would be to eat someplace else and head there afterwards for the live music and No reason to ever eat there I m serious the food is that bad andThe food was horrible and The view was spectacular but its a restaurant and in that vein the Oasis did not deliverVery disappointing service with people at the table got and later after to management we the other The only excuse was the runner went to the wrong table and we were told it would not happen to anyone else Won t be backWe went at sunset and were willing to wait and enjoy the view Finally got seated at Service was slow we were ready to order but the were When the food not everyone got there food of were missing Even though the waiter said he would get the that were missing they didnt come until we had almost finished people out of seven had The manager could have less Worse service bad food and a manager that was even worseBottom Line View and bottled brew Eat before you go and snack on their chips and order the Unless you are just itching to waste money on dinner Don t say you haven t been Do NOT bring your elderly here They will do too much standing and waiting and it s too loud for them Sunset And The Oasis NOTHING to do with THAT We brought in a birthday cake and The Oasis was nice enough to bring it to us after dinner bring and new silverware Our waitress was pretty good but we were an party everywhere for the parking lot You can get call ahead seating Beautiful building and and statuary everywhere and chips were good was standard issue but edible was outstanding TERRIBLE Five in our party our food five after we ordered How can that be my husband ordered a hamburger medium rare which well done and COLD If he t so hungry he said he would have sent it back they keep the under a heat lamp in the kitchen and them out as the come in My dinner was almost inedible I have had better food at My rice and were cold despite the scalding temperature of the plate Food plentiful and but maybe The Oasis you get drunk enough during your long wait to be seated that you t notice how terrible the food is And it really is THAT terrible Too dark outside Even the college we were with had to get their cell out to shine light on the But I understand they keep the off for the sunset but after that can t they bring the up just a little or keep little on the tables for reading the menu I would definitely order BOTTLED BEER here That way The Oasis can t mess it up It t too loud for me but I can see the elderly would have a lot of trouble here Unless I want to just sit drink and watch Lake Travis I won t go againNEVER NEVER EVER AGAIN Good Could their food AND be any worse I mean who up Long island iced tea AND lemon drop Oasis the so obviously they know they can serve sub standard food The one star is ONLY for the view It was and we t been to Oasis since the lake filled up We had out of in from and decided that on their first night in the sunset would be magical at the Oasis WRONG We had a minute wait despite many open tables that were obvious EVERYWHERE So we went to the inside bar to the left the upstairs bar was not open where the tables were too high for the I thought it may be a fluke like just with our table but they were ALL out of proportion what professional establishment does that Then there was NO wait staff so I went up an ordered three and a lemon drop The deer in the bartender at me like I had ordered a red nosed reindeer fizz Twenty later I stood and at the bar again NO wait staff he handed me a lemon drop in a weird two tiered wine glass and three that had about an inch of liquid from the top of the glass NO lime garnish lemon garnish sugar rim NOTHING BAR TAB for those Then we were seated to the top left area despite the fact that there were tables open on the right by some annoying BRIGHT that all their broken tables junk We picked up our silverware and one table over thinking the bright and garbage heap were giving us the nose No It was just the whole atmosphere FINALLY the waitress us us with water We ordered chicken as an appetizer then lettuce A pile of chicken are to our table barely warm We ordered these about a year ago and I recall the quantity being about double The was just meat rolled in a flour tortilla no cheese no sauce nothing Salad was room temp salad dressing ranch was store bought with chopped Lettuce were edible but not very flavorful NEVER EVER AGAIN will I waste my money here Buy bottled beer even their Chard tasted like wineWhat a Joke This place was terrible in and of our time All the are right service is absolutely terrible I came with a party of and yes I know that s a big group so we t expect perfection We got seated at and it was an hour before the first plate hit the table To make worse they brought out people s food and then we And And And the rest never came The waitress t even notice later we got a manager involved A grand total of went by before the rest of the tables food Even then were sent back because they were cold Normally I would blame this on the kitchen but I feel the waitress a portion of the blame Our waitress rarely came by the table and as a result my table had to get their own from the bar after watching them just sit there melting in front of us The manager in all his wisdom thought it a good idea to give our table attitude only making the situation more difficult Each person got taken off their bill when it was all said and doneMy first trip to after hearing great on this restaurant I to eat there we min for a table no but here is where it fun min after we were seated I finally stopped a manager and told him we had yet to be by a server drink order t taken NOTHING He took or drink order and away In the another table was seated behind us drink order was taken right away and they got chips and I was extremely upset the manager said we will make it up to you I promise you will get great service from here on out WRONG They brought us complimentary and Food was great but by this time we been here for we have to have our sons to their Camp in min so I ask the waitress to just have our instead because we need to leave She but to wait on everyone else min later she still t gone to tell the kitchen and out comes our food plated for us to eat I ask for and our check so we can leave I get the check give the waitress my and she comes back with my receipt and its MORE then what the first receipt said By this time I had enough I sign it and just leave I guess when the scenery is as beautiful as it is there and its such a touristy venue the service t have to be good Its a shame but we won t ever be backOn a evening we for min to be seated After another min the waiter up and me who seated us I found it very weird question But then he that who seated us should have brought the food menu and he stood there reluctant to go get the menu To save the day we just went ahead and ordered the for the rice and came cold the shrimp very spicy hot the portion was definitely not for at best for one and waiter forget to serve us the tortilla chips to start with The food and service was a great disappointment Apart from the beautiful lake view nothing will bring us backI can t decide what was worse the food or the service Don t even care to go into detail it was just badYou know those that get away with bad food and HORRIBLE service just because they own a beautiful location for their restaurant to sit on That would be this place What a shameHorrible meal slow service Best part of the night was when we left Weird smell throughout the restaurant Fish were oily and bland an employee sneak a toke behind a bush Would not recommend to anyoneThe star is for the view there was barely anyone in the restaurant so I m not going to use that as an excuse for the service Sat us outside which is great but when you do that common sense you should probably check on your table for water I had to get up and ask the manager for water our server was nowhere to be found We had a table of Food was average then our tab came gratuity was added as it should be since we were a big table but come on now for that service No we of course But then we all get back to and what do you know we were for the amount we for the restaurant and they said oh we don t keep the receipts like a crock of and they want to rip people off to get their share for their ass service So obviously if you go for the that s why everyone is going make sure to KEEP your receipt or take a picture of if they will try to you overThe view was great but service was atrocious It took a long time for just to come out we had to ask for the waitress to check on the status Our chicken came out with a small side of ranch so I the who brought it over for another one for in which I saw the same bring other to another nearby table When he by I him if our ranch was coming out and he told me to ask my server for the ranch When our food came out we found a hair in the fish Only nice thing about this place was the viewWe had to eat dinner here but once we were seated and at the menu we were less than Nothing really caught our eye especially for all of the that we had about the restaurant I had wished we would have checked Yelp before going Good margarita gorgeous but it t for us Definitely t recommend We headed to Lucy s on the Lake and we re loving it hereNope I was here for a private event our group booked a private room with them Since I had already known about the bad food here from my previous I t much to begin with However the service was so terrible it sent me to the floor The entire time there were less than people serving our group of I a tab at the bar and they kept my credit card Upon leaving I had forgotten about the tab that I had and they should have me of it Keep in mind this bar was private to our booked room and only people in our group could ordered from it I eventually got my credit card back by calling them four different times to ask about it only to be transferred around different people and the host stand In the end I was able to get my credit card back with on it DOUBLE of what I had gotten I never closed my tab so I never any receipt This place is staffed by a bunch of high who don t understand service or have much common sense at all With bad food AND bad service this place literally nothing to offer any moreView is great food is airplane food Get Don t eat My husband and I came here this past weekend I got the shrimp which was It was one of the worst I ever had I m not when I say I had better airplane food The shrimp was and rubbery the rice and were bland and there was almost zero spice I was so disappointed especially with this being a signature dish and with that kind of price tag My husband s sandwich was I never written a bad yelp review before but this me tooAlright so the only reason this place got a star instead of a zero is because of the view It s nice being outside The food is terrible mediocre at best and way over priced The atmosphere inside the restaurant is beyond Definitely in need of a cosmetic make over The staff is friendlyThe view is always beautiful but the service and people with golf can be terrible We were seated right before outside on the patio after we were finally by a server I her for for our table And after an additional she brought I another one off her tray and said we need three more and would like an umbrella for shade for our baby She but you have to wait because I m busy we ended up being and sat with who was very pleasant Food was decent and came out fast The man who took us to our car on the golf cart was a complete prick When we to the car he said i can make change My husband i don t have cash and he said come on man that s how i make my living he t me for money yet but once i the conversation i said oh i think i have cash one moment He at my husband and said i don t like Like excuse me He t lie He t have cash i did He kept hounding my husband and sister in law My sister in law gave him and i gave him Obviously still t good enough because he continued to be rude Honestly it to where we won t go back Poor service by our first waitress and poor service by the golf cart company Not worth itWent to the Oasis for lunch today with my brother and sister in law from North We did not have a good experience took min and food another min Never saw our waitress during the min wait Food was cold like it had been sitting out for awhile Waitress no Did offer to have a manager talk with us with a roll of her Assistant manager came by and and no apology He did our after we but he made us feel like this was the only reason that we The price of the food was never an issue I just dislike paying for cold food and poor service Poor attitude of the staff and management Will not be backIf you enjoy mediocre at inflated then this is the place for you Yes it a fantastic view but after that novelty off you are left with a truly unimpressive restaurant With all of the great in this should be at the bottom of the listWent back recently for the last time Absolutely Initially I thought our waiter was going to have a seat and eat with us in an kind of way He was obviously very VERY hung over Food came out timely Oh except we were missing one meal Had to flag him down to see where it was And then we literally never saw him again Like at all Missing plate came out and we finished our meal Then comes the ticket Except it t come we been finished min min min All the while staff is walking around us looking and then moving on their way We get up and start looking for the manager Hostess said she will send him over min we go back and inquire where the manager is oh we t tell you our table number Well you t ask an hour since we finished our meal are restless are p d later we finally get our bill And the manger sure to point out that he d our one meal that was late I expressed that after waiting an hour and for my ticket that was like the bare minimum he should have done Service was atrocious Food barely adequate was excellent Management was horrid Should have just gone to s All we would have is the And those t worth the frustration and wasted hour of my lifeTerrible service Our waitress was incompetent and the wait was insane An hour and a half for food and even worse from the staff Don t waste your time hereThe owner not hired enough staff so therefore the wait at least a half hour for one drink and over an hour for a table The place is dirty Don t waste your time Go next doorWorst customer service gotten from She lied to us about our turn This place is beautiful but organization you d be waiting for your turn and people after you get seated regardless of of or outside or inside t get seated was with us walking out upset and obviously she her job I m from and won t be visiting this place again Thanks for nothingHave the ever eaten here This place desperately need their menu from The view is amazing but the food is terribleThe his place should closed Food is a joke the service is beyond horrible and the staff is rude I think we re pack it in and head for sonicLong wait even with lots of empty tables min wait way too long wait too many screaming No chips will never go back a lot for the worseThe food is terrible We been here twice and we love the scenery and to give it a second chance on the food Trust me it s not worth spending money on food here The are worse They serve you tap water Come and enjoy the scenery but don t waste your money on foodThis is the first time for our family there The food was terrible expensive slow service rude event it was quiet when we they put us sit way back corner with a little view if we can move up front the manager said NO because fire code but everyone came after us he put them sit up front Another B S thing was about chip and I saw they brought out to every tables but not for us after we so long for the about I them why we t have any chip and the guy gave us a dirty look and brought us some Stay away from this placeI took my here on behalf of their request and I am extremely with the awful service Our waiter was in another world He was never anywhere to be found for most of our meal He only brought out chips and because I for them None of the staff was able to help us out with getting the check though we Since we had to drive back to we t sit around and wait on his I went to the bar to see if I could pay my bill Bartender said he could print it out but t process my payment I if he could just bare this one request for me and seeing cash in my hand he obliged I was not going to leave a tip because are When we were leaving suddenly our waiter up probably thinking we were dining and dashing Can t believe my dad still gave him a tip the valet was the guy in the whole place The were surprisingly good that night but please don t waste your time here If you really want to experience Lake Travis get out on a boat or ZIP LINE with Lake TravisThe only thing good about my visit to this place was the view They give me a table I ask the hostess if I can move to a different table she say let me ask and the server came and bring me chips and The hostess never came back so I t move the table at that point because we already have some food on the table Any ways I ask the server if they can write on a desert for my girl will you marry me Because I to her that day the day before he say sorry we can t but I can bring you a brownie I was like no that s fine We order food and eat and the server came and bring the brownie he ruined the whole thing even if I say I don t want the brownie Si my start about it why we get that desert Anyways my whole experience was horrible from the beginning to the end I tough since it was the next day and t busy that day they will be able to help me out but no they don t give a If you go to enjoy the lake Travis view go there and have some Food is not impressive regular Probably I will never go back By the way I tip the server even if he t deserved Just because he might change his mind about next time someone ask him to help out on his special date Get your people in the right mind it s a business we pay to get I get it some people don t tip but that s not everyoneAmazing view and that s it Nothing else Despite the wonderful view the quality of the food is far below the expectation I I took my in to meet the restaurant WHY Anyway I ordered Chicken fireball as a starter and it actually was pretty good However of the we ordered were extremely disappointing Two Atlantic salmon and the Grilled Shrimp The fish was and cold The sweet potato cake was bad and the crawfish cream sauce tasted like cornstarch only The Grilled Shrimp was terrible The shrimp was the bacon was cold and soft as if it had and then The rice was really bad It was cold and hard as if it had beenIt took an hour to be seated on a night which was fair enough because it was nice out but the were awful and inconsistent either way too strong or too weak We over an hour for mediocre food and the poor waitress was so because she probably had at least tables Food was cold and crap Manager was and his attitude was off when food was raw hamburger View was the only decent thing but not worth it Would not come backThe service is just terrible The first time we this place I thought maybe it was a bad day or wrong server Nope we came back for a second time and service for just as terrible I understand the are great but not worth the over priced food and horrible serviceGo for the view Leave Went for lunch There was a minute wait so we headed to the bar with our toddler We re classy like that I usually wipe the table down with a wet wipe because my to put his food directly on the table Good thing I did The wet wipe came away practically black with filth I mean they must NEVER wipe down the tables in the bar and they must rub old on them after FILTHY So there s no food in the bar just booze The blonde bartender was a Catch You Next to my husband and people are generally very nice to him Whatever My view from the bar table was directly into a men s room stall whenever the men s room door was Awesome So like we stayed for lunch anyway We were seated inside next to a door The booth was rickety and shabby there were hovering and I generally felt like I was in a Waffle House on the wrong side of the The food was nothing special The tasted store bought my son s was generic at best and my husband s wrap was just To be fair the bacon on the was very generous and it was pretty good The high chair they provided me had a broken strap and by broken I mean it like a crazy wild animal had it s way through it The high chair itself had was filthy and had not been down since the last customer or ever for that matter My son literally out of the chair twice and into my lap because he t strapped in Overall this place is the Motel of You go for the location but you know better than to bring aI will give rating if I can Terrible My husband and I for and twice but no one actually came over and our At first they us to order but there is no button to place the order on the and then we again They said they will find somebody for us Another Still no one come over They don t serve water or menu Meanwhile we saw lots of just sand there or have their lunch Also another family came and then got water and food in I m not sure if this is racism or just terrible but definitely won t recommend anyone to go thereSo I was super excited about this place out while visiting this past weekend for my party Myself and other came in for dinner to take in the scenery and ordered a couple of chicken and chicken as well as some Immediately upon leaving I felt ill but it up as it being with wine I had in the day Fast forward to am and I was sick as a dog spending the entire night throwing up with another one of my The following morning a few felt sick our driver and the last of the group got sick this morning All but one got sick and she was the only one who t eat the with us It was a combination of nausea vomiting fever and the cold As the bride to be I was pretty bummed out because my bridal party worked hard and spent a lot to plan an amazing weekend and it was cut short due to eating dinner at the Oasis We spent our last day in drinking ginger ale and eating soup when we could it on street like originally Needless to say I will definitely not be back and wish I never ate hereHoly f k When I order a pina and margarita I expect there to be a slight buzz Think about accommodating your with booze in your on the profit marginI went here the day after my birthday and I m so happy we because this is not the place to go Luckily we only went for a drink This place become a complete tourist filled after location The staff was rude except for the inside bar area they were pleasant and when we if we could order CHIPS AND they said no because we had gotten from inside I completely understand that there are certain ways of doing but we to give them more money Nope The manager comes over and is a complete and total explicit language Then to say this is a family place and have that was about the only thing we could agree on I won t come back here Between the manager and server customer service it is in fact not like it was a few back Completely unprofessional and just down right disappointing Food is mediocre at best anywaySo been here and family ate and done and I was still waiting for my to be cook since the first time was not as we later still haven t came out to cancel the and for the check Waiter came back and said he told the manager twice and still the still t came out I For the Manager when the check came and told him We were here for and still no Manager said is an item that longer than most on the menu Really More than Shrimp fish Then he said he t think it was I have a text to my wife and son the food because they were walking around since it was taking almost an hour the time Manager came to y all to me At I think it was more than so please don t tell me how long it took Attached are of my text with time stamp when the food came out and the receipt with time and manager came out with true AFTER we which is after per the receipt l Also don t take longer than most t going to say anything but the respond down that manager me away Need to train your manager betterI have been here many loving the view and the food is On this last occasion it was my daughter s birthday she was super excited and to know what the bell was for we the waiter if it was for her to ring the bell and she said yes me know what it was for I up with her because she me to be apart of it when a waiter up to me being SUPER rude my daughter DONT TOUCH IT I EXPLAIN THAT WE ARE WAITER SAID IT WAS AND THAT IT WAS HER BIRTHDAY he gave me and my daughter a rude look and said ITS ONLY FOR WHEN THE SUN And talking to a customer in front of us about people being dump for ringing it all in front of my daughter my daughter was so hurt not because she t ring it but because she was embarrassed by what the waiter and the customer where talking about us I say this if my daughter t next to me I just away and to her not to feel bad shame on you oasis check on yourWay over Food is marginal tables are way too crowded on the deck Won t return Too many other great on the Lake andThe Oasis as to be one of the biggest in Great view and the are good but the quality of the food is very very poor We have eaten here on separate the first time was mediocre but acceptable The second time was poor but we thought we may have just caught the chef on a bad day so we gave it one more chance The last time and it will be the last time the steak were barely edible the waitress agreed to replace the meat but the fresh serving was equally bad Clearly we were being a high price for poor quality low grade meat meat we would think twice about before giving to our dog By all visit The Oasis to enjoy the especially at sunset but stick to the menu and not the foodProof in point see response from management We appreciate your feedback and hope that you give us another try soon They obviously t even both to read the entire review because they would have seen my annoyance at the canned This is what they say to almost every single negative response Oasis management try to at least be original in your if you can t do anything about the horrible foodThis place is just like every other person ALL VIEW nothing else so don t expect good food here just put it this way the chips and were my edible I had on my visit here The next best thing something you can t f up is a beer rita it was a decent size frozen with a beer inside I haven t even gotten to the service AWFUL When we in we were not and stood there like for a full five until I broke the silence and said can we sit anywhere By the way there were about seven all standing AND sitting behind the hostess area if thats what that even was After I that one of the said we to be seated by a waiter or waitress If it t for a engagement dinner that was taking place there I would have dipped the moment I had to stand awkwardly at the hostess area I ordered a flavored for my first drink it tasted like box alcohol and a thin layer of grenadine Don t order this Be safe and drink a beer ALSO funny but they don t even carry Patron here or any other type of tequila besides For food I ordered the notice the parentheses anyway I won t be coming back here not even for the nice viewNice view if you can ever get seated Don t expect to eat here because the food is terrible and you die hungry waiting to get your order The is rude and you can t walk to the bar and order a drink yourself because the will just ignore you To bad there is so much about a restaurant on the lake when it s this bad Some management and a few other such as actually that mean something other than go stand in line with everyone else who a reservation might shake up a bit Some real t hurt eitherGosh the here are amazing Worth the drive just for that but keep reading to hear a little about our less than amazing meal and service I t recommend this restaurant considering our first experience Brought my son who flew from for a sunset dinner here on his first night in I been bragging to my son about how cool is so I what I thought would be an amazing place to bring him to boy was I wrong Our wait was two and a half before we figured out that the staff completely forgot about us excessive yes but we were exploring and taking for the first hour or so After inquiring about our wait the hostess to seat us immediately I shrug it off cool We re We walk around half the restaurant as the hostess us to not one not two but three dirty tables and then up on her search and is to sit down at the dirty table and she would clean it Not so cool but like I said we re As soon as we sit down our waitress up and something like do you wait or something And at us for sitting at her dirty table Oh H E double hockey stick NO Needless to say the tone was set for the rest of our visit to this establishment No attempt was made to smooth over and our waitress was so rude she eventually left us to our own accord to find someone to get us our check What a let down I really to show my son how cool it is in but clearly this is not the place Wish I could give more than one star but I don t want to let my fellow down Sorry not sorry This place is a N OSimple if you eat at a fine dining area where the mood is set and food is this is that place for you Horrible food I off with Fireball and cheese dip got the and bit in to one of the to find out the center was frozen Cold So I for our server and she the situation by my table another batch of And same problem once Again I m Eating Instead Of So at this point that s strike strike was the Salmon that I Ordered Tasted Raw and no flavor well I was like whatever until again the center of the salmon was cold and uncooked and really My boss And his Wife were not very happy with there food either because the server did not bring what was ordered This Establishment Must be very well for the beer and Scenery But Food is Trash sorry I give this place aThe view is beautiful but the food is borderline We ordered and an appetizer The appetizer t hold up to Chili s Everything tasted canned The had the flavor profile the especially tasted horrible I have no idea who came up with these menu and no idea why they thought that bell barbecue sauce and work well together The other was incredibly dry had no salt whatsoever and tasted very bad Any fast food is better truly The view is not worth the food I don t know if they care because the view the line long but it s absolutely not worth it Go to the bar to the right of this I haven t tried their food but my best guess is that it can t get much worse than this Edit I hope the owner some response to this and toFood ABSOLUTELY but the view is awesome Recommend eating before and just coming here for and the view Note if you re fair and sensitive to the sun like me there t many with shade so bring your and if you re coming in the day Definitely don t come here good food or service and then you won t be disappointedGo for the view or don t and go upstairs to one of the other The food was disgusting and soggy We ordered two two chicken and one Nothing and I mean nothing came out warm The had obviously old meat in them making my daughter sick The had old stale and soggy chips It was just awful Our waiter and never came back so we just got the check from someone else and left What a tremendous disappointment in food and service a beautiful lake How sadThe kitchen early evidently in the winter based on the service throughout the day night The valet is very hospitable and courteous as he informed us that the kitchen early if its a slow day as we at when they close at I was not the only vehicle turned away as there were roughly or that to the up the road due to the early closureThe view is beautiful but the food is borderline We ordered and an appetizer The appetizer t hold up to Chili s Everything tasted canned The had the flavor profile the especially tasted horrible I have no idea who came up with these menu and no idea why they thought that bell barbecue sauce and work well together The other was incredibly dry had no salt whatsoever and tasted very bad Any fast food is better truly The view is not worth the food I don t know if they care because the view the line long but it s absolutely not worth it Go to the bar to the right of this I haven t tried their food but my best guess is that it can t get much worse than thisThey bring you food with missing I ordered and just the came When I the year old food runner where the chips were he said he get them later we still didnt have chips When I saw our waitress I waved her down and said its been and no one brought us chips She said someone will bring them It s now and still no chips I went up to our waitress and if she can go into the kitchen and bring us our chips she me baby and said the chips will be right out At when they brought us our food they then brought us our chips I told our waitress we want to speak with the manager and she said the manager is really busy I was for that response When we down and was ready to eat we we have no silverware I a worker if we can have silverware He said yes and was never to be seen again Our waitress came over to check on the food and I told her we been waiting on silverware for now At she came back with silverware I to speak to the manager again and I was told he was really busy NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK I WILL TELL EVERYONE I KNOW ABOUT THISnot one to really get mad at but this one really topped it I could go on about how horrible the service was but just say it took around to get my drink Which was WATER and when i ran out of water it took another for him to come by and what he had to say was also if you need more water you can go over there and get it also his favorite sentence was oh i forgot The food was good It wasnt great but it was good very for how not good it was In the end i dont see myself or my date ever going back unless its for drink on the balcony because the view was great The service was notUnfortunately when you come here come already full and for and the sunset Order Eats and then go inside The service is horrible the food is horrible After so many disappointing here I payed it safe went with a house salad and added chicken I think they my order up My chicken was cold but my lettuce and dressing was warm My yo son who is a body builder and eats more than a horse ate his double and felt sick were great the beer the and the Still go though it s fun Then go to P Terry s after you pay your bill for bad and warm salad like we didhere we go View is awesome that s why they get one star and the fact I can t leave First the service Host staff great very attentive and fun I like around with people in the service industry because of the way to many out there but The waiter he can I say for he everything so he t recommend anything then how about we he s not a drinker so nothing there So we through a not so menu and ordered some stuff none that was too and half was cold when brought to us Our waiter who I won t shame came by once and if we to split our check and when I told him no he stated good because he when people do that because it they are cheap Now I like to around more then the next guy but really know your audience Then I if he working there because I just retired and was thinking about a part time serving gig He then told me well if you don t have experience good luck because they won t hire you here really although I haven t been a server in about I guarantee you I had more eating out then people Don t go here seriouslyto come here with my service dog and hostess Carol was extremely rude and us service to sit on the patio Apparently she never of the Will not be supporting this businessDon t come here for the food you be completely disappointed Regardless of how much The Oasis on Lake Travis Yelp to put all their decent good to the top and remove some of the honest bad most will tell you to avoid this place The view just t worth itGreat view location Not for They have a patty that is in a non bun If you re not a it s probably greatService I will never go back and if I want to enjoy the view I will be sure to do so from the outside Went there because of the view We to find outdoor to have a meal and enjoy the view also saw that there was some kind of band later and to come back for later in the evening as well BUT our opinion of the place quickly at the very first with the staff I to take on my to post on I a to snap a photo of us He said sure and took us over to a young woman who was sitting on a bench in the outdoor area with a professional camera the said she will do it she is better at it and is a professional and left us with her She was quickly to get up and walk around with us while I was trying to give her my to snap a photo of us She did not like the location and made us walk around to another spot I recommend this spot she said the view is better here For some reason she declined to take a picture where I it then after us around for good ten she said that she was not going to take on my because she was a professional and was going to use her camera and charge us a lot of money and that i would not be able to post on because I would not have them on my sell phone So here we go we t able to even sit down yet and we are already for lots of money I felt mislead and that they thought I was an idiot Needless to say I told her I was sorry to have wasted her time we turned around and left I will never ever come back to this place that made me feel so terrible about myself No amount of view will make up for the treatment I received If the t want to take he should have just said that not pass me over to someone who to make lots of money off of me for the service I did not need and was fully capable of snapping a And we to give them our money for dinner and Not any moreso i m here for soccer and i in the past few days i had a game this morning and i m so we order a chips and to eat before we order I been waiting now and there s still no Keep in mind it is for one ounce for this expensive i t be waiting nearly half an hour now for my food i m hungryNot at all what I was when the Fried Shrimp The shrimp were coated in what tasted like carnival fried food batter It was flavorless and greasy The shrimp itself was over and bland For this mess was not worth it at all The restaurant as a whole is The food is as is the service I can t complain about the wait time we at on a and were seated almost immediately Our waitress however spent more time her phone than waiting her tables My family and another family beside ours were left waiting for our for There are a few other on Lake Travis I would suggest eating there instead of wasting your time at OasisStaff so racist because we are When we wait in line for reservation us while took reservation for another people behind usThe are amazing but the food is horrible I have been there times and I am always disappointed food wise This time I only made it to the appetizer because I t want to waste my money This place can have so much more potential Update the menu add more and retrain theThe view is beautiful the sunset to dazzle but there is nothing more to praise Bad food lousy service which you have a bad experience Unfortunately not worth a second visitThis place an amazing view but the food and service is horrible I ordered a and i took one bite and it was the worst which came out to be It t have any flavor I for something I t get to eat Our waitress was not doing her job right She would have our guest pass each other s around instead of her coming to give us our I most likely would not come backand bland food with poor service We almost before our waitress brought chips and after we her In fact our food came before she brought chips and is watered down and not at all spicy We something with a kick but they don t have anything else to offer Even the fresh which they charge you extra were mild Overall poor food taste and bad service is not the that will make me ever visit them againThe only thing nice about this place is the view The food is and Go there for a couple and eat dinner somewhere elseOne star for the beautiful view Food was only customer service was horrendous We came with a party of on a fairly busy After several of us ran out of water we our waitress twice for a refill before she We additional and finally the manager before someone returned with water That was about of waiting and the left without all glasses Our friend finally got find his own water Ridiculous were missing from the order and not brought out until after we finished the Nearly comical We to deduct from the tip added to the bill for large the receipt told us we could add or subtract as we saw fit Four days later the charge was posted with the full tip my husband to speak to management for a refund They stated they did not keep our receipt and agreed it was unethical to process it for an amount other than what was Our overall experience lovely mediocre food abysmal service and a touch of fraud We won t beWe were excited to come to this area The view was great but could have had the view with a much better experience somewhere else We sat at table and our waiter was rude and service was incredibly slow Our cold after we Had a margarita that tasted like salt water with sugar in it Not worth it unfortunatelyWe to confirm if the patio was dog friendly twice and was told it was When I brought Bob along with me I was by the host I spoke with the manager and he also confirmed that this place was not dog friendly A little annoying how you re told different but that s just the beginning I t bother with food because I read from previous that it s over priced and not good Therefore we stuck with and took in the view of Lake Travis There are over here but if you re looking to stay cool or warm inside the wait can be up to We the wind sat outside for the view We over the strong here and had and almost my phone flew out of my the conflicting information with the dog policy the service is pretty slow and the are small I m sure there around the area but it s surprising that there are only a handful of in the s bathroom and no room to form a line to waitThe place is nice The are awesome the are strong The food Horrible Not good not tasty But the make up for itI had to give one star to write a review how does this place even stay in business No wonder there are inside the seeking ALL of Been here with server after server passing by the table they sat me at after to switch tables due to screaming crying baby in my face on the patio Not one of them if I was being I would leave but there is a crash causing major traffic and I can t get home here are crazy All I can do is laugh out loudBeautiful view of the lake Service was awful Checked in with the host and were told it was a minute wait An hour later we checked and were told the area we checked in for was first come first and was now at capacity After demanding a table somewhere after waiting an hour and being turned away we were seated on the deck A free appetizer was provided and a manager came out and for the mistake He also to expedite our order It took an hour to get our which were cold My rare steak was completely well done and cold I returned my plate and declined a replacement Nice place to get a drink and watch a sunset but don t waste your time or money trying to eat here I don t plan onTHIS PLACE First of all service is awful Let me take you through my experience I had a group of with me we were seated immediately and if we to sit inside or outside we said inside and they almost seated us but we our and said outside so we were sat outside at THE TABLE IN THE WORLD WHEN THERE WERE SHADED we to be inside and they said there was no way to seat us inside due to HE size of our group so they to us a more shaded table which was fine The were also staring at my group like bitch do u have a problem it was the most awkward thing and all the girl were at the hip and everywhere together When I got my food I for ranch THREE times before I got any which was also like later We got our check and the waiter split it up evenly and I ended up paying almost double what I ordered so that was awesome this place I will not be Used to go here a lot a few ago but the place gone to y allI live nearby and I t feel like cooking Since my and family are with me for the holiday I decided to treat everyone here I have this place ago and I thinking maybe they just had a bad day Coming back here was not worth it and it was definitely not worth the of spent Food is not good were watered down And the keep random food to us when we haven t even ordered They need to change the chef and service I forgot how bad it was The only thing good here is the viewWe up just after and were told if we to eat inside it would be an hour and a half wait There were ample tables indoors it was not busy but we t even get food at the bar So instead we had to sit outside on the water on a degree colder than usual day The wait staff was up and my party was clearly miserable I tried to go inside and warm up by running warm water over my in the bathroom and after there was no warm water in the ladies room Can you say health code violation What a miserable experienceThis is a little late It last year We had a group of family from out of the country so of course we went to the tourist spot We lived her and been there many times They to allow my wife in because she had a bathing suite top with her shorts We had been on the lake They forced her to buy one if their She t wear it at the table so they to serve her and the entire group had to leave ridiculous for a restaurant by the lake or any outdoor restaurant in the summer in Not to mention all the flesh hanging out of all manner of other tank tops and short shorts Any private place can set their dress code But we don t have to spend our money there or recommend it to anyone especially out of town company like we have all the time So we won t be going back there everOne of the WORST to go for FOOD in Ask yourself why this place only on YELP with over and you know why These must take pride in their poor service Like a commercial Hey they don t give us for nothing I live only away and WOULD NOT recommend this place to anyone living in town or visiting The OASIS is a collective of Ice cream and specialty gift THIS REVIEW TO THE MAIN RESTAURANT The Restaurant at The Oasis My son and I at on a evening for a summer dinner of just this was just recently We t been to the OASIS for nearly four because of our last experience We thought we d give it a second chance and see if it had since our last visit in IT T We were told we would be seated in about because the kitchen would close right after The host said generally speaking the wait for a table is but because we just before we d be seated faster She took my phone number and said we d get a text when the table was ready The restaurant was moderately busy with many and already leaving when we It was the only restaurant at the OASIS that was open despite all of the in the of the and other saying they were all open until in the summer To our surprise the entire complex was dark and closed abandoned really even when it said they were open This was just a regular week night too We sat inside the restaurant and for a text but it never came After of waiting and the entire restaurant was clearing out we why we t been seated Three of the young at the front desk were just chatting and getting ready to close down Their response was you t get a text And I no They then said it s not our fault The kitchen was now obviously closed We left immediately and went to another restaurant on that was willing to seat us Around the OASIS is well know for sloppy service and generally poor tasting If you want to buy just their alcohol and take in the view then fine but there are expensive too I would not recommend this location or the here to anyone The view of Lake is great but everyone in this place is terrible They don t care Management t present and service is poorly Don t waste your time or money at the OASISTerrible Disgrace to food Look at the view for free this place is tourist attraction Wait was min no chips n had to ask horrible to one chunk Bland Take in the view and go eat somewhere elseI would not waste my money on this place again for they took over to greet our table the waiter had a very bad attitude with us while taking the order and t even ask us about what we would like or if we would even like any moving on when my you get brother tried to get his attention because he a drink because he was thirsty the waiter told him to hurry up because he was busy while my brother had just got his attention very rude he hurt my little he is only old that there already boiled my blood I guess there was supposed to be chips and at the beginning which we did not receive until we actually got out food that would have been great to get before considering we were especially because it had already taking so long to get our order in by the time we received our food the waiter had only stopped by the one time when he told my brother to hurry up we all were thirsty with the dry food and all of us literally all had empty not even ice in them of how thirsty we were and we were sitting outside to enjoy the view but it was very hot and we only got to enjoy one cup of whatever we had to drink since our server to have a huge issue with us him to attend us as well I understand being busy because I am a waitress as well and I am always very understanding with the food company but the service we received here was horrible and the food t too great here either the I received was very dry and the sauce I my waiter for never came It was also my mother in birthday we tried to him at the beginning to surprise her but he ended up forgetting and I had to tell him again the surprise after he brought the check I will most likely not be coming here again to dine the only reason I would return would be for the view I t recommend anyone to waste their money at this establishment eitherThis place really gone downhill The sandy walkway maze filled with garden and and other odd is gone They it and put up a parking lot Not only that a driveway with valet parking Are you trying to be fancy Oasis We know better You sold out The service never been great but it really now The waiter assigned to our table t very personable He our but I some degree of friendliness My date ordered with no he is allergic Our food fairly quickly but the guy who our that there were in my date s food If someone a dish a specific way they are generally either allergic to an item or they just don t like it Would you risk failing on that ONE request Apparently the Oasis would Now we know the t made to order which probably they were frozen Gross What restaurant with gorgeous and valet parking t make food to order The plate was sent back and I while my and fruit baked in the heat Waiter comes back and they can t make the without so my date to look for a menu again He proceeds to ask the waiter if certain have in them when the waiter if he is allergic or just t like HOW RUDE What on earth does it matter I m a vegetarian I m not allergic to meat but I don t eat it and I would probably not have a good reaction to it if I did Does that mean I should put up with food if it meat in it because I probably won t go into a coma and sue the restaurant Date finally received his food and we ate our in peace A few tables over a couple of were yelling at people on a balcony to stop throwing beer one of which may have actually hit one of the I t see it happen but I saw her pick up the bottle off the floor The table next to us had screaming which is fine my sister one now and I understand Behind me a woman was sitting on her s lap making out with him I don t get what s up with the clientele here When we got the bill the waiter neither for the nor made any off the bill for the problem I t be if the staff here received absolutely no customer service training I won t be backTheir customer service is horrible They over my card and when I and them if they could pull my receipt because I was just there a few days prior they conveniently tell me they don t have it The food is just The only reason people go here is for the view Now that I seen the view I would never go backWe had always that the Oasis had a great view but was an awful restaurant but after living here for decided to give it a try Bad idea This restaurant s average is That s just not fair It should be lower The view is great unless the sun is in the sky as it was when we We could only get a table outside in the weather needless to say it was sweltering at our table where there was no fan and half the table was in direct sunlight The were good but the service outside was excellent from our waiter who to get us a table inside At this point I was optimistic Sadly our waiter did not follow us to our second table took a turn for the worst when we got inside First I had no silverware or napkin water in cheesy plastic After waiting at least the waiter up took and I was left to look around at the extremely tacky onto the It like something out of a Cracker Barrel Had we to we could bought some of that ugly crap and brought it home because there were was a gift shop in the corner So cheesy Our food it was mediocre at best We saw our waiter towards the end of the meal service was awful This restaurant me of a third rate theme park We won t be back This restaurant me of a third rate theme park We won t be backPreface This incident during the lunch on my fiancee had been a tough few days so I decided that a lunch at The Oasis and some at the brewery later would be a good way to decompress a bit We get to the restaurant and greet the hostess and ask for a table for two outdoors and are quickly out by what to be a young male employee He was instructed to seat us at table which was already taken up so thinking quickly he took us to another table I believe only to find that the table had not been yet Being courteous and trying to do his best the young man seated us at a top table rather than us awkwardly saunter back indoors to wait for a table Which is what should in the first place to avoid all of this Once seated at the table a few pass before one female who had been standing at the hostess stand comes by to give us a strange look and proceeds to ask if we had been seated there by someone we respond yes but what we were thinking was no we just to stroll right past the host stand while being somehow undetected from wherever it is they are and the first table we saw which by the way was not easily visible Anyway some more time and a different female who was also standing at the hostess stand to come and rather than say someone will be with you shortly or someone will be right over to take your order she to ask the same question we had already been once more only this time with a more tone She then to inform us that we could not sit at that table because it was meant for despite us not to be seated there and informed us that there were no tables for two available at that moment She then to ask if we would mind moving before immediately doing a double take to instruct us to move because apparently there was a party waiting for a large table one that we again did not ask to be seated at By this time we were both and with the situation and to speak to the manager we were to the host stand and to wait there for the manager to arrive about later To the manager s credit he did listen to us and to find us a table quickly but by that point the whole experience had left a sour taste we to leave and told him we just to inform him so it t happen to in the future Thankfully we hit up Lupe Tortilla instead where we were to food that may have been a bit more expensive but was likely much better and most importantly we were not to relinquish our We then topped it off with a visit to Just sad to say that The Oasis been ruined for us star for the viewFood was lack luster and service was horrible took an hour to get our food and the server was gone most of the time Would recommend a few of the beautiful view but don t waste your time and money at the restaurantIf I could give this restaurant no I would The Oasis is s quality with a good view and a higher price point The food is less than lackluster and the are worse The shrimp were not seasoned room temperature and tasted like they were from the frozen isle at not even H E B quality Honestly if you actually like food don t waste your time This was all topped off by the horrible service Our server was rude and inattentive She the check onto the table never how the food was and basically t even try We t get out of there fast enough Hopefully y all let someone who how to curate a menu buy this establishment until then I won t be back nor will I EVER recommend The Oasis No need for a pity review from management I t even go back for a free mealHow do I loath thee Let me count the ways I loath thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach you get the idea I m a native so I been there since this place in the s when you could just grab a after a day on the lake This place was just before it burned to the ground several ago I mean it was a ragtag restaurant with wobbly tables and rickety holding onto the side of the cliff You could put up with the poor service water and hit and miss food because it t TRY to be anything but a fun place to watch the sun go down Fast forward several of later to what I call the PLEX It s a restaurant no it s a gift shop no it s an art gallery no it s a strip mall with shopping no it s a wedding hall no its corporate meeting place no it s a There are two you can count on when you visit The Oasis They will succeed at feeding you disappointing food even if they get the order right and they most certainly will reward you will poor service Enjoy the sunset it s free for now until they figure a way to charge you for that too I think said it best They paradise And put up a parking lot With a pink hotel a And a swinging hot SPOT Don t it always seem to go That you don t know what you got Til it s gone They paradise And put up a parking lotWe were in on the weekend of and before heading back to we decided to go here because it really nice in the We had a party of about people We were seated right away mainly because it was really cold outside so there t many people We got seated at a table with a good view that was basically the only good thing about the whole experience You know after a night of drinking you re really thirsty so most of us got water and were done with them in a matter of The waitress never came to check on us The chips they brought us were the got hard after a few Finally the waitress came by and we for another round of and i for the drink menu because why not have another drink plus their actually look pretty good But i guess i never find out because she never brought me the drink menu Finally our food came and we were so hungry at this point I had gotten the shrimp and they brought me chicken so i had to wait another for my plate while everyone picked at their food The rice black were BAD No good taste The shrimp was And the had no type of flavor and just tasted a bit dry We finally got our bill all of us dissatisfied with our meal and not full at all since most us didnt even eat our food My bill was for and came out to a total of NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE If i knew i was going to spend this much on service and food i would have taken my money elsewhere You re basically paying for a nice view But for a view is quite a lot to meaw Oasis i m going to have to go all fire breathing dragon on your ass your suck we ordered they after quite a wait warm and where were our shakers here s a tip just because you put a margarita in a glass does not make it a oh and you d think for i would at least be aware that there was some tequila in there even the cheap ass tequila that you pour your food it s below average and way over priced we had a hello t flour pretty much the food around like around a penny a piece so the other was for that mediocre filling at room temperature and that thimble full of mango pico gee thanks and even your chips and suck and really how can you f up chips and your service is atrocious slow and just plain bad i can t believe you let these do important like handle money we had to ask for water three times when I that my was not only warm but tasted really bad our server said sorry and away then another server to our table a small bowl of and when we told our server that we had not ordered it he said oh sorry i try and get it taken off your bill try and then surprise it was on our bill at which point i turned to my friend and said is this guy going to make me be a bitch because i hate when people do that it s really against my nature here s the thing oasis owner you should be ashamed really just because you own some magnificent real estate does not mean you should gouge your for food drink and service it is so painfully obvious that you worship the almighty buck above all else and take no pride in the product you sell and shame on you for the beautiful real estate you are lucky enough to own by it k and a shopping center soon to come in the name of more is any amount of money going to satisfy your gluttonous self indulgent greed apparently not so why would anyone ever return if this place is so awful well while we try to avoid it last night our band was there and we to support them on other we have been to there and even when your is free it still and sometimes it s nice to show out of your amazing view but we do all of that begrudgingly you do get one star though and that is for consistency you have consistently ass for the we have lived in and despite your amazing potential to be a great place it you settle for being consistently as you kick back and count all of your for shame fire breathing dragon outWent on a evening the wait time was an hour a half to two for people We got that our table was ready after but had to wait to get seated because the host had ran out of silverware Got seated with a horrible view They sat us at a large round table that was for people We ordered the chips which was the only decent thing during our visit because of such limited Service was horrible Waiter came to our table about times during our visit but only because we had to call him I ordered the Oasis it came with sweet potato that t great at all This place was not worth the drive at all Extremely disappointed in the service from our waiter on view scenic Food was not even greatI been in for a little over and have made The first was many ago the only two I recall is the awesome view of the sunset and the mediocre food The second visit was about ago for one of the first with my sweetheart Thinking that had hopefully in quality of food and service Wrong Still I had an awesome time because of the company and the view Yesterday was my most recent visit I only went because I was to meet that were from out of state While waiting on our table I went to the bar to order a margarita Their selection of tequila is extremely limited Ordered their Perfect Margarita and watched the bar tender make it All Seriously For something sold at top shelf it was horrible That was my first and last alcoholic drink of the visit After being seated we ordered Chicken and Chicken I thought both were good but I t help to notice that between of us more than half of each appetizer were left untouched I ordered the Fish I give them a out of Good thing I love because it was good I m never going back Such a sad waste of an awesome setting It really t take much to spruce up the menu food and and the service but after all these I seriously doubt it will happenWe went to the Oasis on a night to have dinner and see the sunset with my and their We at sunset at They told us the wait would be and put us in their system later they sent us a text but we t see it They have a policy of to respond We came late after when we checked to see our status and then we t seen the text Their response was we should go to the end of the line at that point they were a minute wait They made no effort to accommodate us So we came to the desk within of the originally time I understand we their policy A place that their policy to the letter as they did without any attempt to adjust is not good customer service They their quote We will not go back It t surprise me that they have about k square of vacant space at their establishment given our experienceBad service food Only good thing was the view I don t think I will come here againDespite the horrible we decided to give it a try All I can say is the view at sunset was incredible and the of bad food poor service were accurate The waitress took our order never checked on us even though we were near the kitchen in the bar We finally got another person to bring us for our a spoon for our However as he our a roach ran across the table He made no attempt to rectify the situation calmly said that when the weather cold As we were trying to decide if we should leave a second roach ran across the table This time my up it He left to go to the bathroom to wash his I ran over to the bar a napkin someone to remove the dead bug from the table Still no waitress Finally a manager came up as we were standing up if there was a problem He did offer to get us a different table and or more food which we declined I just to get out of there He did our mealCome for the beautiful view It s a massive level restaurant that can accommodate virtually any size group you can throw at it The are weak the food like something you d order at Chili s it s all too expensive and I had an extremely hard time even down my waitress Beautiful When I with a party group there was live music on the top floor bar The band a variety of adult contemporary crowd and they special attention to the birthday boy in our group to help him feel like the guy there They did such an effective job of him on a pedestal in fact that it convinced my I t cool enough for her So at this point I d be pretty happy if this giant tourist trap burned to the ground and slid into the lakeThis is the WORST experience I have ever had It was my wedding anniversary over was told to get back in line just to find out how much longer the wait was absolutely ridiculous Such a tourist trap no customer service Whoever this restaurant should be immediately fired If I could give this place negative I would They will never get a dollar from me There is a reason every local will tell you to avoid this place Food is to say the least are weak to boot Go at your own riskLet s start at the top upon arrival a young man who clearly t want to work told our party it would an hour and half before we could be seated after walking to the balcony and looking at the amazing view we came back and suddenly literally later he had at a table for us We sat and forever to get a server They up the order They over us for an already menu and to top it off The food is frozen food that is I will pass and so should youIt was mine and my first time going and for the fame this restaurant I way more This restaurant is good to visit for and only The food was really disgusting dry burnt and the was almost black We ordered a for and the oasis The had no taste whatsoever The chicken in the was so dry and burnt the same for the steak The rice tasted like microwave rice and the pico de and were almost rotten The only good thing was the chips and My brother in law went two before us and he had the exact same experience as us The only thing him and his was the blancoI would give this hotel a ZERO if I could So many wrong Besides the incompetent staff all around the food was gross and came out late and the seating was horrendous They have horrible management Literally You can find so many other better to eat in And around please please don t waste your money It was awful And dirty Literally nasty and kitchen So Imagine what your food goes through Manager Not a good manager And there was another main woman manager HORRIBLE Literally the worse experience I ever had in my life at a restaurant They don t want to listen to It s pretty sadFirst time we have been since post fire restoration are still tremendous but food is horrible Service effort was there but fell far short We with bean cheese The and cheese were It was a plate of chips and with a scoop of sour cream Terrible I ordered fish with cheese only They with only fish no cheese It took about to get our attention She said she would get a side of cheese Cool She came back about ten later By that time my fish was cold sitting outside with a brisk breeze I if she would mind my fish She informed me they don t reheat anything I said you can reheat them bring a fresh order or take them back and bring our check She took them away then came back a few later to tell me they would make another order All good When the new order it was missing the and lettuce the first order had which I but she took Decided to eat anyway and I m still it Could only eat one of them Will never go back Forgot that my wife had a that she said was like drinking a glass of waterIt was beautiful BUT the food was terrible My daughter s was very over my food was spicy so I eat it I was NEVER what I to drink I did have water thank goodness I drove a long way and was justManagement no crowd control it s a free for all and management and agreed They need to do a better job seating waiting on mask policy and spacing people out do better If it t for the company sunset it would been a complete lossI was excited to come here as a customer and receive exceptional service but all I received was a cup of water and a hour wait time at the table I came all the way from to visit and saw this ad about the restaurant so I put it in my itinerary Unfortunately it was a waste of time We went to the host to tell them we for the server to come back so that we can order our food After another no one came to no manager was there to be found We were very at this point and left the restaurant The host saw us left and t even say anything The server that we saw at us and us For all of you who want to have a fine dining experience I regret to inform you that this is not the place for itThis is probably by far the worst food I had Bland tasteless and tortilla were straight out of the packet At least thats how they tasted We went on a chilly day and they to seat us by the fire We had to go back and ask for one Ah and talk about the service the waiter to or make any remove or add stuff I saw some old on yelp and for a enchilada She blatantly said whats on the menu is what we have what you saw is an old menu that we don t have See the and decide for yourself the rice too It just weird period I will go back to lake travis and definitely NOT dine at this place I am not sure how people are still eating here There is nothing vegetarian on the menu that we and what we ordered t turn out well Ah Awesome view with food and service The waiter will be busy helping other tables so she may not get to you to refill refill chips I will not be going backVery bad service We been waiting for for our food and still not We left without getting our food It s not worth the wait and the drive There are other great inI always of the place and t ever tried it even though I live just a few away Decided to go there for lunch today and was horrendously disappointed Sure the view is nice but the food is unexcusable I legitimately felt at the price I for the quality of the food we received It s a shame that a place like that is serving such sup par food and I had high for the place but we won t be This place needs either a menu with new or just kill the food and serveThe Beef shrimp tasted like they came straight from the freezer bag section at I t touch them and I told our waitress nope not worth it I would have been nice to eat good food with a great viewI hate to do this I love water I love I love huge and and and hard and eating after being at the lake and the Oasis all of those But the food is just so bad So Bad And service slow And my whole group not weighing over the got stuck in the damn elevator We for approximately it eventually up a little and we were able to climb out The manager s reaction wait for it Yeah that WHAT I would give it an extra star for view but bad food long wait and getting stuck in the elevator Not the Oasis to anyoneRude staff and food Don t go here Lucy s is way better food is good and patio is awesome with great view We always come to oasis the view is great but the food is pretty bad This time we had our small dog with us We a day ahead to make sure we could bring her because we were visiting from out of town and on our way home The person on the phone said it was perfectly fine as long as we were outside When we we stood in line to get a table There were several staff just standing in a line looking like they were hung over and not friendly When we finally made it to the counter the girl told us we t to bring dogs unless they are service I even on patio She said no She was incredibly rude and hardly up I told her we to make sure so how was this possible She just at me and t answer So we will not go back Not of the dog but of one girl s terrible attitudeWell first time that i been here and yeah pack a lunch because the food star is way below par for such a view your basically paying to see lake travis the chips and are good so you could just come for and and u could have a good trip here but if your hungry do not come here because it is not worth the trip when will if they are serving you cant give crap just because you have else going for you check out in same quality as food as here but with cliff diversYou need to take your of the scenery and then it out of there Do not eat at the restaurant Old dingy furniture carpet like wet dog and the customer service was piss poor The are ridiculously expensive because the food was absolutely disgusting I went there with my family and not one of them their meal And to top it all off there was a bug in my drink and instead of it promptly the waitress just said she will tell the chef to keep an eye out for next time like what Nasty food nasty environment the atmosphere me of a flea market YuckWent for the first time for a party dinner terrible experience The like they had never only Took before we even received water Our waitress Amy B finally took our never what sides we she gave me double We had to ask for chips and for the table after we all the other tables had some Food was and I had chicken and beef and they were dry and tough Waitress never came back to give We finally had to ask another waiter for our check which was together instead of split Over it took about to eat an dinner with terrible service that we had to tip the included gratuityExpensive mediocre food Bad service Crowded space We were told it was going to be a to hour wait as we after sunset to a visibly quiet restaurant We decided to wait and went up to a gift shop Returned to ask for a menu to look at and were told they had taken our name off the waiting list because they thought we had left We were sat down at a table and our waiter goes straight to taking our drink order while speaking in an voice and this demeanor for the rest of the night He by and out need anything while headed somewhere else reminder the restaurant is not busy At the end of the meal someone in the group for a to go box The waiter turned around to get the box from literally the table next to us then it at everyone while saying here I forgot who for it We then handed him our to pay and he them next to a bus cart He pointed at all our until we handed them to him for him to put them in the bus cart then and only then did he take care of ourLet me say that the are off the chain After an one hour wait for food which came to the table cold as the iceberg which hit the that boat they made the movie about The food was so bad I would feed it to a homeless dog I had better food in the Army and that is to include Would come back yes for music and most of all the sunset and that s allbefore with a party of today and was told there was no wait at all By the time we the wait was an hour for inside dining No big deal we were happy to get and wait Over an hour and still no table We were told for an additional that we were next in line After waiting for an hour and twenty my husband went to speak to the hostess that informed us that all they had available was outside dining We did not put up a fuss and took the outside table Ten after our and food our waiter came and my husband are y all going to out or would you like the check now My husband we will wait and take the check AFTER we are our food We not even been our meal and the waiter was trying to bring us our check Waiter then COMPLETELY deserted us We did not receive our food for an additional hour after we were seated Another waitress this and took our service over Absolutely ridiculous The entire table was their food except for myself Waitress finally returned later and is there anything else I can get you before I bring you the check I said I never received my meal How does a server not realize all but one person was their food I eventually received it as everyone else was up their to go Our original waiter did then happen to come back to make sure we our receipt Two and a half to not be my food until we are about to leave We will NEVER return to this establishment againSuch a beautiful area The were amazing Luckily the wait t too bad we were worried about the long wait times I can t imagine waiting for a long time and not anywhere to wait at especially during heat wave Unfortunately our experience t the best When we got to our table it was sticky and wet Be aware of their silverware ours were dirty Their menu was very limited due to Covid which is understanding If you order water tap water I recommend you soda instead It gave me a bad taste We out with chips and best thing we ate We ordered the club chicken and the For the price it did not taste that well My chicken club was very bland dry and the tasted We order the medium and it came out well done with a weird consistency My potatoes were burnt We also order some of the special it could use more alcohol I do recommend getting tropical depression drink Taste more like a tropical It was delicious but definitely more alcohol Had high the food t hit it for usFood was terrible like all inclusive resort in terrible and a plate for beef view is awesome and definitely a fun location but eat before you go and just haveOasis More like NO Am I right I m fairly certain The Oasis only to take money from dullard and college high school I honestly don t know anyone over the age of that ever come here a time Is there anyone on a weekly or monthly basis that Man I have too much money laying around Where can I get awful service from year and after a bunch of awful frozen food that I pay WAY too much for and choking down or terribly sweet bottom shelf go home and wake up with diarrhea Oh right THE OASIS First off don t order a dessert here I m certain they just buy it off the Swan truck then sell it for Secondly the really for a margarita made from well tequila and sweet and sour mix from powder What s wrong with you If only that fire had actually this place you would have gotten the message Thirdly the food You d be better just going to Chili s and eating out of the The stuff people don t eat from a chain restaurant is better than this crap The powdered cheese mix you call is a TRAVESTY What Community College drop out this place Lastly the view It s a nice view Of an ugly mud puddle of a been lake People talk about the here like they re amazing no it s just a sunset And you re basically force fed prison grade cafeteria foodare horrible And this was the clean bathroom A toilet seat and or less to replace Ridiculous As much as they charge for the food I m sure they have enough revenue to replace the toilet Had I seen this before I had lunch I t have ordered anything Food was which I already new from the last time but the view is great I to bring a friend here while I was inDO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE FOOD I took my family here on My wife can t have dairy as she is nursing and our month old baby a bad reaction if she have dairy She specifically about non dairy when food and where told the chicken club was a safe choice They even wrote NON DAIRY on the order and it comes out with the bread in butter The waiter and comes back with a new bread without any butter Turns out the chicken was fried in butter and their bread have dairy in it as well and now our baby have a bad reaction They just don t care and any serious establishment would not make a mistake like this Our month old baby thanks to their negligence Not life threatening but he is in a lot of pain The food tasted good and the waiter was friendly but the service was not good I for a refill of water twice and we never got any That said the view is spectacular which this a shame It could have been such a great experience for us to go here but it was not I strongly recommend you to stay away from this place based on ourI must say that I had such high for this place since I had that about this place I even throw from to to go visit this restaurant Upon to the restaurant we were told that the wait would be an hour and a half to two We said no problem will enjoy the view Unfortunately it turns out that all the were locked to the exterior therefore we t even enjoy the view When we were finally seated it literally took to get our to the table I this place only a fork in your silverware package I use a knife when I eat in order to avoid my to push food onto my fork which is what most well mannered people will do I the waitress for a knife to which he only come with the that require a knife Imagine that Since I ordered a I guess I t warrant a knife The at this restaurant are among the most expensive that I have seen for this level of food I ordered a hamburger that was to me in a plastic basket like if I was visiting Dairy Queen but unfortunately this sub par hamburger cost me If you to add a couple of of it would cost you another The were extremely cold and leathery and to be honest with you this hamburger and was not even on par with My wife s that look like they came out of a frozen dinner and without exaggeration came with about of rice and tablespoon of for the bargain price of Oh and by the way this place the distinct honor of the most expensive I ever seen in a restaurant before Each soda a whopping Not considering the view and where we were at I could understand getting a galaxy on for the location The food quality was horrendous but what made this experience worth was the fact that it took over an hour for our food to come to the table No exaggeration I gently tried to hint to the waitress by her how s everything going in the kitchen to which she I don t know I m not to go into the kitchen The poor waitress t even understand what I was to To sum up the review I would say that this place without exaggeration is probably one of the three or four worst restaurant that I have ever been to He cost for this level of food are ridiculous the service is horrendous and I am frankly that this place is still in business I would recommend that you come to look at the but please stay away from the food Do yourself a favor go to and get a cheeseburger that will blow this hamburger away This place is awfulWe went to the Oasis for our th anniversary and the Hot were They were great Except that our waiter was never around and barely kept us in Except when he brought more than we for For literally hour he was not to be found and we to leave So we what we and left the money On our way out a bouncer not us saying that we under our bill We settled appropriately However t it have been easier to have BRING US THE BILL as opposed to otherwise Management we will remember this and it will affect our next potential visit to the OasisMy and I went there for the first time and we both were very disappointed He ordered one of the oasis and was VERY bitter but he t want to make a big deal and just t drink it and ordered a beer instead He then ordered the which were plain as if those t seasoned at all I ordered the fish and when I got them they were literally COLD I sent them back The second order I got the fish was warm but the were still cold and hard at that point I just gave up and ate only the fish People know that if you go there you re going for the view not the food The food t worth the priceIf you re going for the scenery that s one thing but if you re actually hungry don t go here Drove from The first table we sat at was min wait to finally get water This t during major lunch hour to another table sat for close to an hour and never received service as to what we to eat what other and to order We saw the waiter and he away from the table I notified the Nothing got resolved I was very and dissatisfied with the treatment receivedNot worth the crazy wait Food was and tasteless Head to the brewery insteadAbsolutely one of the most horrible customer service I ever experienced We stood at the cocktail bar n the floor for over right at the bar in front of bar and not one of them even said hello let alone us what we They were just going about their business cleaning and It was not even close to being busy So we decided to go to the third floor upstairs where the order taker had a very bad attitude and was very rude to us because we to change out a beer since it s only in a small glass and t come in a bigger size glass The food is below average and over priced The view is great but that s about all Management is non existent We will certainly never return again and do not recommend anyone else to come hereWhat ever you do don t eat here You might try an appetizer if you feel guilty but don t eat here It is so awful HOWEVER the view is AMAZING Enjoy a drink probably a beer because the are made and there is no alcohol in a call drink But just ignore the staff get a seat right before the sunset and ENJOY Then get out and eat somewhere else It s a good place to take to see something in Very touristyThis establishment t even deserve one star I am honestly left speechless I have never such a horrible disgustingly rude wait staff They my cousin like garbage and ruined everyone s night because they were so upset that she came until At one point they even tried to offer USED DIRTY To the staff and management All of you should be ashamed and embarrassed for the way you this was totally uncalled for and unprofessional If you cannot be kind to someone don t even seat them You owe my cousin an apology and refund To people reading this please never support this place everWe tried to eat here today with our dogs because the yelp profile said it was dog friendly However the hostess Carol was rude and when provided emotional support animal documentation she stated she someone to verify it because anyone can get one One the place is suppose to be dog friendly two you re not to question if someone you they have an On top of that she was incredibly rude The place beautiful but holy get better staffThe whole point of this place is the view We were given a table behind the staircase and next to the service door So far away that there t seem to be a server assigned to it Disappointing experience to say the least Food was fine but you can get that anywhereWORST experience with food service and billing The view is nice and the service staff is nice but that s about it are outrageous and the eating experience is sub par AVOID at all costThis establishment only to one time and t think about longevity for You re going to pay for the view with food that is sub par and service that is even lower After our fourth visit here to bring an out of town guest we saw unprofessionalism and a lack of customer service from both the and a manager After giving this place several we won t be with future The only star rating would be the view and we can find that elsewhere with better service and foodWhen one of The Oasis think of it more as you re paying for the rather than the food and Not sure if this is due to covid but the menu is limited You have a few and basic along with diluted alcoholic Our server fantastic So friendly helpful and truly about customer service Our don t belong in Not only were they small but that UMPH to it It tasted more like margarita mix than tequila We had the combination for our meal Typically when come out you get satisfaction from hearing that piping hot sizzle However expect lukewarm meat here don t even get me on how bland the wasIf I could do negative I would from condescending hostess to over worked waiter with too many tables not even mediocre food and horrible management where to begin Why did I go Had visiting from CA and on our tour of memory lane of my beloved and from what I remember from my last visit to this spot ago they had great of the lake I recall the food being so was not and I had set my there First when you call ahead to ask for a party of when is the best time to arrive because they don t take The hostess said so to be conservative we up at Even then we were told it would be for table outside reasonable enough At the hour mark I went to ask the hostess about the wait she was incredibly rude and basically at me for even She even said it could be another hour We should have left and this would be the end of the nightmare But I t We were sat at at a table in front of that were so strong our and me yes we re flying off the table had to be hurricane level wind from their fan Seriously the hostess with stuff on the table Thankfully they turned it off The waiter took more than to great us and finally took our drink and order The before and chips no We ordered by By we to ask about how much longer and could we at minimum get the food first At the first wave of food only Nothing for the who were beyond their breaking point part of the food arrive and all the food had We had to request twice for management to speak with us the guy that did bother to show up at me I was not amused They said they would take care of us and gave us off our meal but when they my credit card it was a adjustment They then said they would adjust it for us and my credit card AGAIN for They would not show me a receipt that the they already me Needless to say there was N discount and I will make it my mission to see this place end Wow I have to say in my adult this was the Worst Place Ever Be this is not a place to take anyone if you want them to like or I sent their management a detailed complaint as per request of the manager on duty and have zero response What does that say about this placeWe over an hour for cold food and incorrect Totally and not worth the price or the wait Staff was nice but didnt have a clue what they were doingI want to share horrible experience with the server Her name was H It took more than min for somebody to come to our table to take our order when we When we ask her if we could get a server to order she said what do you want No whatsoever Than we ordered appetizer and main entree Our entree came before the appetizer so had to cancel the appetizer When we told her that we want to cancel she just said i t realize the entree would come that fast Again NO Finally we for more but it t come at all and when we told her that she said They come from the kitchen i put them in Again she t APOLOGIZE and she was RUDE ARROGANT MEAN AND SHE HAD AN ATTITUDE Please train your better than thisI want to share horrible experience with the server Her name was H It took more than min for somebody to come to our table to take our order when we When we ask her if we could get a server to order she said what do you want No whatsoever Than we ordered appetizer and main entree Our entree came before the appetizer so had to cancel the appetizer When we told her that we want to cancel she just said i t realize the entree would come that fast Again NO Finally we for more but it t come at all and when we told her that she said They come from the kitchen i put them in Again she t and she was RUDE ARROGANT MEAN AND SHE HAD ATTITUDE Please train your better than thisGut food Heartbreaking service This monument to mediocrity is a testament to the motto location is everythingI am SHOOK that the food is so terrible You re paying for the view but that s the best I can say The table and are and quite filthy Twice my napkin was on with food The picture is my plate of no joke That s not even the worst part The were not edible and that was not an exaggeration I had to spit it out You re walking a pretty long distance to actually even get there then to wait for a table and come to find out a table for two with no alcoholic us Only who don t know any better come here My advice to anyone visiting is maybe have a couple of for the scenery and get the he out and even then the Oasis brewery is better for that Review update this Oasis rep person will ask you to them about your review and do nothing about it This is a front to save their terrible brandthe view is BUT it just t enough Our latest experience was a dud to say the least First off why is valet but they work on only Whatever The are nonchalant and our server t much better When she took our we about for our appetizer which was a total joke Complete lack of taste coupled with a mound of iceberg lettuce to fluff it up in a downward spiral into the oblivion of hunger On top of that what like an eternity came and went with no sight of our waitress My water never got We had sat there for a good hour since without getting our seemingly simple two and two chicken Were they the lettuce from the out back Were they the chicken Who We left a bill and it a day I know people must think this is a place for the view but then why not make it a romantic cocktail bar Or huge wedding venue Being a restaurant with mediocre food and almost non existent service really is quite shameful for stealing such an excellent spotWe were waiting in line so we could get a table only one person was taking I had to announce that all of these people won t see the sunset and there was behind The seating station a manager was even at the seating station he did nothing So I again in a loud voice ask why can t you people work and get us Only then did a teenage girl came out to help the manager left and did nothing Service was so bad Our food tasted like someone honey on it I sent it back and t eat the chips and hot sauce was nothing but small broken and hot sauce was watered down I m from been there several times but t eat because it s always food I was taken there by someone that never been there and she was very disappointed to see manager and he never came by the table I want either my money back or a The place is run by teens that don t know anything Please contact meMy review is obviously the majority of posted for this establishment Management t seem to be too concerned with fixing the by the canned to everyone Obviously they are in enough business to ignore the overwhelming negative feedback that they receive The Oasis a few going for it except the food Gorgeous large dining comfortable casual however the menu is just awful It s astounding that so much money was put into this beautiful location to rebuild after the fire but it t appear that any attention ever been put into the menu I private business here which included and it was awful as well I wish this place would revamp it s menu and cooking staff and make an attempt to create decent food there is so much potential here I do not recommend eating here however if you re looking to have a margarita and watch the sunset this can be a great place to stop at on a weekday The are busy and service is terribleI went in for an afternoon cocktail and dinner Host seated me near the edge at a table with a beautiful view I sat there for with several walking by and no one even acknowledged I was sitting there I out after no one came to take my order Beautiful terrible serviceIf I can describe the taste of an unwashed ass after a good sweaty day then it just might give justice to the good cheeseburger that I was handed Alongside that atrocious meal I had a hurricane beverage it would make the meal though that t the case It was delicious Don t get me wrong the drink was tasty but I might been better off the drink off to my year niece since their were juice and vodka but don t worry it s grey goose Besides the gorgeous view of Lake Travis don t bother coming here You be better off throwing some pizza in the oven down a beer and come enjoy the view without spending your coin Hopefully when everything up more will come to offer But seriously don t beThis past weekend I brought a group of over to The Oasis I had so many about the place but had not made it over there in the I lived in Got to say the view was fairly amazing HOWEVER DO call ahead it apparently the wait in half The wait was apparently supposed to be with the call ahead but it took us a full hour to be seated The parking was bad DO use valet It s and it will cut your wait and seek time for a parking space by a lot Watch out for bad they tend to not know where they re going The service was terrible The line to pick up a to get seated took about Then we at the outdoor bar area for at least hour It took us over to have a server come over and take our order We multiple and to find out who is covering our area No one to know who was covering it In fact we had to harass and for them to even acknowledge our existence Everyone to be new to The Oasis It was maddening Finally we got our appetizer order in and about later it was off Very mediocre I seriously think that the was Pace Around we finally get seated First one waitress came by and picked up our drink order Then later another waiter came by and for our drink order which we had already given Anyways the communication between the wait staff non existent A little while later we all gave our order I told the waiter that I was a vegetarian and all He made some I picked up the cheese enchilada s and black When he off the order he goes I made sure the black don t have meat and then he the plate of chicken and in front of me Unfortunately I was engaged in a conversation at the time and t touch my meal until after my buddy had eaten an entire cheese enchilada apparently he was wondering where the chicken was The food was very mediocre Anyways long story short AWFUL service huge bad food but decent and an unbeatable view I would not recommend this restaurant for anything else then a fewHonestly just not great food Sure the view is good but the food is not fabulous It s actually pretty bad I can tell that most have been The chips and are way sub par for If you want good food and a better view hit up the Oasis Brewery upstairs The atmosphere is better and the food is actually good They are completely unaffiliated with the Oasis Restaurant so it s actually not a giant fire like the place downstairs Staff is friendly food is spectacular and the beer is as good as any craft brew I hadIf I could give this no I would The view yes is gorgeous but the food the service was horrible came out cold some were cold some were hot tasted like like it was made from cheap alcohol Way too many people for the amount of wait staff We hardly saw our waiter Overall the only decent thing about this place is the view everything else is way over priced and disappointingEveryone told me The Oasis the best view in My and I spent the weekend in and came here to check out the much view that this place had to offer We also decided to grab some lunch too while we were there This restaurant is huge The t really friendly when we They just let us stand there while they around No one acknowledged us After a good while we were led to a table outdoors ATLANTIC SALMON chile salmon char grilled with sweet potato and topped with a crawfish cream sauce The salmon was and bland The seasoning was off because there was no bold I something flavorful but I was given a dish that was just a disappointment The crawfish sauce did not do much for the dish It had a lumpy consistency and did not taste like crawfish SOUTHWESTERN LETTUCE fresh lettuce grilled chicken black bean and corn fresh avocado and sweet chile dressing The lettuce was the worst thing I ever eaten The were bland and one noted I thought the sweet chile would add some sweet or spicy addition to the dish but it t The corn t have that crunch that I would and the chicken also t have much flavoring to it either Overall this place was a huge disappointment They did have a nice view but it s not worth the drive nor the money to dine just to get a look at some water and in the horizon I had fast food that tasted better and had more flavoring Never againNot a great experience over priced food to see a beautiful view of the lake Seen they had a love everywhere So went and got one from the gift shop and wow want a rip off for a dollar store lock I know to up the price but damn that much Better off your ownOasis More like the We had people in our group who all ordered different and all of it was extremely dry and toughEnjoy the view because that s the only good thing about this place You re better off going upstairs to the brewery and a biteGreat view That is about it Service and food was Please take my advice before you drop your money on the garbage they serveSo I went because I great but experienced the total opposite in line and was told that we would have an hour and a half wait time and they would text me So we and and no text Went to the counter and they told me to go back and ask the at the door about how much longer the wait was So I went to the at the door and was told that the counter the same place that I just from would have the information I went back to the counter and they for my information and it was not in the system They got us a table t have the best view and the sun was almost down by this time The waitress did not care about anything it is a very busy place however after waiting for so long was about another hour for our food No update nothing Although we were not able to get a good view it was beautiful but the service was horrible the food wasGreat view not a great experience Our group but said we could be into smaller at on a evening We were told it would be about and hour wait because we to sit inside which we were fine with We were not seated until even though there were lots of visible and we were seated outside and were all together which was nice Our waiter did not come to our tables for a good and he was the only waiter for our some people group Our chips that come with the table did not come until after we were seated Food came satisfactorily quick but the delivery of food was chaotic and was difficult to tell whose food was whose I ordered the classic no tomato onion or add cheese It came with tomato and No lettuce or cheese I was upset because of the inane wait time and because they basically gave me the opposite of what I ordered The was quite good but I was disappointed that my order was wrong The waffle were fine but I got a bunch of instead of big normal In conclusion my experience at the Oasis on Lake Travis was lack luster and Next time if I came here I would come and take with the nice view as long as the sun t directly in the eye line and then leave and go somewhere else to eat maybe to another restaurant next doorDon t trust the bragging about how they don t do because they can seat so many people the most in It is indeed possible for there to be a substantial wait in my case The person at the door said that although they can seat rarely do they have the entire restaurant open to the public due to private Call aheada week ago Service was bad The food was worse The inside restaurant smelled like juice The price for the quality of food was ridiculous Very poorly Complete disappointment The view was nice but eat before you show upA lengthy drive from anywhere Impressive albeit crowded Long and wait times describe The Oasis Mediocre food and to follow review my experience with three while a small thing two of us did not receive our correct change no given one person never received the spoon she for I about a side substitution and our server said if they could accommodate my request he would just let it ride and if not he would let me know He never returned until I received my food without my substitute service and food leave a lot to be desired only one of us out of four our meal they supposedly text you immediately upon your name to the waiting list to confirm your phone number and a second time when your table is ready we only received one that said out table was ready yet we were initially told that this was not the case and another It was cold outside and the heater next to our table was out of order so we inside A soda as does hot chocolate which comes in a margarita glass with a straw weird Needless to say I will not returnCame here with my wife on a evening I put our in and was told the wait was No big deal since it was a holiday weekend and I m sure one of the days We went over to the brewery next door to grab a couple and kill some time Come about into the wait we decided to cancel our spot in line and go to the bar on the top floor since we were told we could get food there At We order a couple and ask the bartender how the process works for food we stopped taking food he said Disappointing but my fault for not when they stop serving food My wife and I sit down and notice everyone around still holding and giving to the wait staff I one of the if we can still get food and he at his watch and you have to order He could not be more unenthusiastic or unfriendly about taking our order He in our order and leaves all the and food waste from the previous party at our table for before clearing it Food comes and it s bad Chicken is and dry wife s is chewy and the are soggy Like everyone else said come for the view not the food Although I probably won t patronize The Oasis again after this bad experienceWhat a dump No social between tables were seated at adjacent tables less than apart despite many empty tables around Server forgot chips and The menu was limited and Ordered which were not in a sizzling platter and were tasteless and tepid for a view and a bland lunch is way Stay awayAn employee came out of the bathroom stall and without washing her During COVID too That is all I need to say Won t beHORRIBLE AS ALWAYS DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY I d recommend only going here to see the view and take The only reason why this place is getting a star is obviously because of the view other than that I been to this restaurant multiple times and received the worst customer service from both the and management and the food and are definitely not worth the price The first time I came I ordered two which were very weak and yet my stomach had pain for an entire week The second time I the Oasis and decided to give the food a try my fish were completely watered down and everything else on the plate tasted gross as well I had them remove it from my bill because there was no way I was paying for those gross clearly frozen and just thrown in the Then tonight I went there with my family and and a half before anyone even notified us about our food Our server was giving attitude the entire time and once again the service was just horrendous She informed us after two that the were backed up YET we literally watched several other tables get sat after us and yet they all got their food long before us We never got our food after waiting for more than and Finally our entire table just picked up and left because of how bad the entire experience was This is by far the WORST restaurant ever This restaurant should either be shut down or have completely different management and staffNot worth your time or your money We were waiting for for the tableaux get really spot we sat down and have been waiting for food for another Still no sign to getting any food soon Please do yourself a favor get good food good service somewhere else while you are in This is a big mistakeunprofessional rude and very bad person st time there and we get at the door Because we could not bring are pound service dog in stroller I mean the view was priceless But service all the Very not good attitude from and he needs to go get job at strict environment job He ruined are day and mood Not goodSo decided to try this restaurant because of the view So it was a hot day but the outdoor seating had at least a thousand So we decided outdoor seating however they sat us at a table that had one umbrella that covered a quarter of the table so we then to be inside Not really sure why that table because there were plenty of that were suitable However the hostess got an attitude That was a turnoff Then we ordered They were however the rice and were cold Pretty sad The staff gave off a negative Overall experience was a downDon t eat here Just get a drink and watch the view Service is terrible There are some that are that s about itWe two for a table which we understood because of the amount of that come here but we t expect to have cold they were sent back TWICE It s rather sad that you wait for that Horrible experience I would only suggest you come see the sunset and grab a drink and leave afterwards Our server was excellent Just food was cold and also no customer should see this while they are dining at a restaurantThis review is based on only my last visit I have been here many times and haven t experienced this kind of worst service before We had this server who to be not interested in doing his job at all forget about decency We the order for and were waiting for chips and which I don t think we ever for it they usually bring it on your table without Well he never brought it and for So we another server if he can get it for us So came to us with the chips and and rudely You have to ask for it we are not like other where they give it without and when I told him we never for it before then he its some usually do that Alright if you never ask me if I want it how the heck I am supposed to know you have it or not in the kitchen After that I saw I m sweeping the floor without and I don t think he washed his before serving anything to other tables seeing that we t even think of food Even his t shirt had some food stuck on his back Long story short I found it unhygienic and worst service only on that day Most of the time the service was goodHorrible experience We re seated fairly quickly After being seated for an entire drink fell and soaked me from the floor above All the manager could say was oh it was water don t worry Not a sorry or offering to grab our or anything Got a new waitress and she was absolutely terrible Took her to bring us a pack of salt Hour for our food and then we get it and it NO flavor Will not be ever Great location but not worth itFew to touch on Food is terrible and that s obvious Second their Gluten Free are NOT GLUTEN FREE I would not trust I did not get out of the restaurant without tossing my Their staff and must NOT be trained in Gluten Free because it been already and I am still suffering This is one of the worst of gluten poisoning I had since I was in My food was sketchy at best I went there ago and got sick but their menu was different I figured I was wrong It s still the same food service where no one is trained or what the other is doingIt took an hour for our food to get out and the t seem to care Apparently there was a party of thirty ahead of us that our order back Tables beside us that were sat next to us after us that received their and left before we received ours I understand that these happen however The lack of attention of any kind to the issue was The view is terrific The staff and food quality needs severe work Don t have any desire to returnIf you want to wait min to have poor service and mediocre food then this is the place for you This is our second time to visit this restaurant Our first time was a year ago and I guess we forgot about how bad it was As soon as we sat down the booth was so far back that I had to scoot it up just to be somewhat near the table And speaking of the it was so uneven that our t safe from tipping Then we look at the menu and see food for chicken and for instance We got up and left after that the food last time was not that great This place t need to gouge regular people just the view is great but they clearly can because people keep coming back I take my money elsewhere and if you care about how far your dollar goes I don t recommend spending them hereThe good the view That s about it The chips and are pretty but I d eat those anywhere The bad Being for a plate of with chicken on it We brought up the problem to a manager and he instead of immediately offering a replacement took a fork and to show us the chopped up chicken on our You d get better at Chili s No They also don t like to offer extra glasses and t seem to bus tables while we were there The service in general is bad Between dealing with a rude waitress the flaky manager for a new waitress who still later t come to our table and another server who picked our food apart to prove us wrong I just don t know if there s a capable person who works here All in all it s not worth it You re better off finding an authentic or family owner place in town than spending your time and money here To the manager I m going to inform you that I posted this but I m also going to say it here Bad service t speak well and it will ultimately put you underTurn back now You have been This place used to be great Then there was a fire And still it came back Now however it s some awful version of the Hard Rock with a good view And the view is spectacular But that s about it The food is mediocre the service is and the are awful Every margarita is mix very little tequila And it s expensive as hell I was so excited to come back here after I away for a few I never return Oh it was a hour wait to boot Valet parking is but we not to do this so we had to park about away After we finished eating there was a pretty decent thunderstorm so we got to walk back in the rain and lightning This place was once great now it s a massive tourist trapThe customer is always wrong at the Oasis They also block off fire so your safety is in jeopardy That is probable all you need to knowCaveat to this came during Covid times Tourist trap mediocre food tiny menu an hour and half for a table only stuck it out because there s literally nothing else in the area that t a half hour drive away They don t take Good waiter was nice view is gorgeous funky very picture worthyTerrible service Multiple had snobby attitude and to move us when the sun was glaring at us or bring an umbrella We before we got drink or better food I am not lying If it t for the view this sad excuse of a restaurant should have Overall the food was very disappointing and the rude service round it out as a place that will turn away repeat Please train your to actually pretend to want to work here and serve without a scowl and attitudeMy family went to The Oasis night I was giving my a treat for something prior in the week When we put ourselves on the hour and a half waiting list I told the hostess that I our table right on the rail on the Lake Not far back She said got it After an hour and a half we were taken to a table NOT right on the Lake I ordered love a steak and chicken I t receive my until FORTY FIVE AFTER the rest of my family had received their food Once I finally got my food I for a to go box immediately as my family was done eating and we had already been there an extreme amount of time Positive if you get a table on the rail it is a beautiful view We t get that though Even though I it and the hostess itgreat for the view not for the food a with no on the menuMy first time going was a HUGE disappointment I went with my and our significant along with my total people I got the all medium well It might as well have been well done because that was the driest bland meat ever My sister got the entree with chicken She said the and chips were so salty she t even finish her plate Everyone else about the food as well The only good thing food wise was the and chips It t even that busy when we went around and the waitress still took a really long time to come to our table to either fill our or bring whatever we Like long At the end of the night we tried splitting the check between two and we whose card to charge for what and The waitress simply t understand how we split it so she just the however she thought would be Which is horrible customer service She should have come back to the table and us to clarify it for her but she t One of my brother in got more than half of the bill and the other person was the remainder I think she did very wrong in doing it however she saw fit Very disappointed in the whole experience would not like to return any time so Update My ordered the fish the night that we went which she got food poisoning from I won t get into the but it was not a pretty sight Now we re definitely never going backLast night we here Our waitress was very rude humorless and dismissive She got no tip I spoke with the manager who sort of Coincidentally we found out this morning that the credit card we used was The card t been used in daysOh hi server yea you that can t smile or say hi and like you haven t been able to take a crap for two Yes service was that bad after a minute wait Will I be coming back Definitely a hell no Oasis if your service is like this all the time now I understand why the low Beautiful scenery yet service and food Anything butSo you don t go here for the food you go for the view for dinner and one cocktail each No so much And then on top of it we ordered the with beef and pork it came to us with pork and chicken We our server over and she was nice enough to leave the plate and just have beef sent down to us A plate promptly came but it was pork My man and I just at each other and laughing The poor thing came back and was like oh no they sent down pork Told her not to worry cause the pork was good Not worth the trouble or the wait I will come back for the view and a beer and the brewery Be weary though you can not take you drink from restaurant to bar to restaurant even though the whole thing is connected And the worst part we were waiting for our table we went to the brewery for a brew while we and I order a second round and come to find that we were being for our table and could not take our so we had to chug worth of beer and wine Unhappy The sunset was lovelyThe Oasis used to have charm that spoke to and alike Now if you are into a like experience with multiple and a staff which cannot be to even smile and interact with you at even the most basic level the Oasis is your place Cold cold cold and totally un So so sad Can t review the food because our treatment by staff was so heinous we leftWish I could leave a negative review if you want a great experience don t go here because you re not going to have oneWorst service ever We were seated within of however once we got to our table we were Several by our table but not one stopped to ask if we had been After waiting for about without even being able to place a drink order we got up and left to find another establishmentDon t know why anyone this place Go to a park if you want scenery Food service price wait all just terrible I would rather stay at home eat frozen and watch golden than give Oasis another try Such a waste You are an iconic spot and all you can muster is cold pork with sauce on top really better dinnerFirst off this place only got on star because of the view Beautiful sight of the sun setting However there is not much standing room as tables take up most of the room outside and the staff is adamant on telling people to not sit at any of the tables until the name is It a minimum of to get seated The staff is exceptionally rude especially the group trying to seat everyone The service is super slow It took to just get a waiter to table and then another to just get water We were left behind for a basket of chips and we never got our water When we ordered the food we t receive one of our and the waiter never came back to check up on us When we for the check we were for the dish we never got It took another to get the check fixed The food t even worth the wait Bell better food for of the price Come for the view and a drink Leave and eat somewhere else with better serviceWow I thought I this place but here goes Oasis is surprisingly big with a huge area for parking that to extend beyond sight However still prepare yourself to try to find parking from far away Yeah yeah Oasis a great view of the sunset Did you know you can watch the sunset for free outside of this place Well if you t now you do As what most people said the food here is It s not horrible but I could go to s pay half price and still enjoy a decent meal that is better We had a large party In fact a VERY large party so I can understand us to ease the pain However it took them to take our drink Then to take our food Then for our food to arrive I did not get to enjoy the sunset with my slightly enjoyable food but whatever I suppose if I was in the desert and this was an oasis it would be quite awesome But sorry we don t live in a desertMy complaint is not about the food or the service as I got to experience neither this trip I have been here before a few times the other times were about ago The restaurant used to be fantastic but now it like they cannot figure out or accommodate the ridiculous volume of people that visit each night I had my party in this past weekend and we thought it would be a good idea to eat at the oasis because I how beautiful and fun it was from my previous ago My sister tried to book a reservation ahead of time but spoiler alert they don t do No problem right It s a big restaurant and we would have been fine with waiting up to an hour for a table while we sip on some We got to the parking lot about and it probably took almost just to find a parking spot No luck on the surface lot so we tried the parking garage The parking garage was bumper to bumper literally from the entrance to the top You re really trapped once you re in there because there are no and it s just everyone driving to the top then back down once they realize there t any The parking garage is so narrow that it s impossible for trucks to make turns or back out making it even harder for you to get anywhere You d think being in they would have that being an issue My sister ended up to drop us off at the front make another round through the parking garage then finally had to just use valet parking for plus tip So then we finally get to the hostess stand where they inform us the wait time is to We t have been able to sit down to order until We tried their very casual counter service restaurant upstairs but quickly we would not be able to find a table We decided we to go to another restaurant entirely since it clearly t working out which meant we had to go back to the valet and wait for him to get our car it t been very long and my cousin had to get her car out of that god awful parking garage To sum it up just trying to eat there wasted an hour of my life and for parking I an average restaurant experience with a pretty view instead I was hostage by a parking garageThe view was great Let me start there The service was not good On top of that our had in it I stopped someone to let them know as we t see our server for a good She left with it and came back with a new bowl She said sorry about that and off I have worked in the food service industry and know happen but it s how the staff it Our meal took forever and was not the best but the was really good I doubt I come back to eat but maybe for a drink over looking the waterI was really skeptical about coming here because of all the bad but my friend in going because of the view If you can avoid this place please do I am a server myself and I NEVER in my life experienced such a bad service Our waitress never even up to greet us I actually had to ask another server to put an order in When our waitress finally decided to show up she was If you don t want to work here my suggestion is to just quit This made me feel really uncomfortable and made my experience here not worth it Food is less than average and really Never going backThe ONLY good thing about this place is the view The food was not good at all and it was over priced I was so disappointed on how the food tasted Also during our whole time there we t get a single refill on our I would NOT recommend this place to anyoneRidiculously bad food would hover but just t land on it Service was terrible recommend you buy a to see the viewTerrible Service I the On with four and my sister We at and for inside table We were seated at We ordered right away as our were hungry By server told us food would not be ready in another while even when food was ready for the table next to us and they later than us Before that I had the server more than once about food status and he said it was coming every time Server to charge us for milk and mineral water ordered in the evening After talking with manager who was busy dealing with other unhappy he and any cost for and View was nice but overall experience was not I suggest going to other in complex Service was better there last timeI never had such service ever in my life that I did here last night What kind of server you by you multiple times and t at least get a drink order if you re busy get someone to help you if you re that busy That s literally what he said to me after I him down before I was about to pass out of dehydration Then I look at the bar and of just standing around not working and could have easily given us while we ITS HOT even at night and people need water especially when we have to wait to get crap food as well We did get a good table on the patio but that was about it We won t be coming back unless it s a week night Fish were gross corn tortilla completely fell apartThis place is trash Only reason why it s open is because of the view Everything on the menu is trashThe restaurant was and phenomenal However the manager was not very friendly to us over our service dog It like you pay more for the view and less for service The food was nothing too impressive to what I was eitherLet s start with the Beautiful and awesome but it there Food was nothing special Had to find our own napkin and no Table service attention coffee after meal server never came back Had to flag him down to get the check Since we were in a party of of course tip was included They do NOT and will NOT split the check to the manager who was standing around and he confirmed they would not split check and further said it could take to run that many credit Since I rate a restaurant on food environment and service I would only give this one out of three Go for the shopping and view but don t eat at the OasisHow bad can food be Come here for the and find out Cany believe I have to give it any for a right out of the microwaveHorrible service Employee got attitude when to leave the sun shade as the sun was shining in our was great but rest of staff an attitude Food was horrible could have got better tasting food at Chili s Wait time was over an hour Only thing enjoyable was the viewThe view is not worth the horrendous experience I had been excited to go to the Oasis for a long while now We had in town and we were on the Lake for the weekend so figured it would be a perfect place to take everyone We got there and used the valet which was only and since we had a big group and a this was greatly We went up to the restaurant and they informed us it would be a minute wait We this and went to the Oasis Brewery for a drink while we The brewery which absolutely no connection to the restaurant we found out was amazing The were superb and the view was beautiful I saw that they had food and almost we stay there I wish I had After we had ordered our about into our wait we got a text that our table was ready Hard to complain about getting let it sooner than so we our and headed over to the restaurant We were sat at a long table with plenty of room for us and a great view for almost everyone in our party The view truly is stunning but so was the view at the brewery I the waiter which of the Oasis they had on tap and if the was the same as the brewery That s when everything to go sour He absolutely indignant that I assumed they had their beer and he pointed out vehemently that they have no association with the brewery and in fact were not on good at all with each other I found that very strange and was disappointed that I t enjoy any more of their The beer selection they had in the menu once he pointed it out to me was mediocre at best so strange they t serve the beer from their very close neighbor Our waiter up sold many of my on the clearly pushing them to the top end That t be an issue if the were even decent they were not They were not even close to the premium we for them It just got worse from there We had two ask to split the for since they were leaving to go home and t use the The waiter was not what so ever by this He treating us like he to have nothing to do with our table My friend even that we would still tip well despite not a ton of food Knowing my they really would have had the service been even decent From this point on we barely saw our waiter He came out once to give us more chips My friend politely said we were good on chips We had eaten plenty and appreciate it He then made one of the most sarcastic and passive aggressive I have ever a waiter say He said It s you barely ordered any food anyways I had to confirm with my friend next to me that he actually said that I was Multiple times we tried to find a manager Our food had not come was becoming visibly aggressive and upset and we were just ready to leave It was absolutely miserable Finally our food came and the disappointment even got worse The were cold All of the food was pretty and not even close to worth the price The next time we saw which took quite awhile we for the check so we could leave We just to go home and put this horrible experience behind us We got the bill which was not small and included an enormous tip At this point a couple of us to remove the gratuity but the rest just to go home and knew it would take a long time to actually find a manager and get the check corrected We it and tried to put the whole ordeal behind us I love leaving positive and really supporting the in There is almost nothing positive I can say about the Oasis restaurant other than it a really amazing brewery walking distance from it that just as good of a view I recommend going there insteadGo for the don t stay for the food Think about it how can they maintain quality on a restaurant of that size Both of us had the seared tuna salad First it was cold Direct evidence of the too big for quality issue I t see any sear though it was just a bit on the outside as it should be other than being cold and not truly seared The liberal use of black sesame tried to obscure any The menu a sauce Not sure where that was It was never seen or tasted The tuna was not fully cut into large and they did not provide The vinaigrette was pretty tasty The mixed were sparse but fresh The mango made a strange combination of It would have been a decent dish if it had been fresh off the grill When we the waiter what the mixed were I can tell you that it t have any iceberg in it Wow But it did address our main fear I get it You go to the Oasis check out the view get a drink and watch the sunset Amazing venue for that But the food I have a rule that is time tested the better view the worse the food That s been fairly correct and the Oasis thatHate to say it but there is terrible and rude service here took just to get a menu and even longer just to get a drink ended up leaving before getting our first drink they definitely forgot them overall will not be coming backMy and i a day trip to get out of We had this place had an awesome view and some decent so we decided to come try it out We t sure about how good the food would be since i had checked some of the on the place but we said if it s not terribly busy we d try it out When we got here we were seated in a timely manner and outside with an incredible view My and i were so excited and t wait to try their Our waitress never got her name took our drink and food order and that was the last time we had seen her She never checked on us to see how our were never if we another drink she even straight at our table while tending to a table full of and away We were starting to feel like she t want to tend to us for who what But our food runner was X more welcoming and hospital than our own server After of still not being checked on we on a busser to bring the manager over that we could get some kind of compensation for the horrible service And keep in mind i work in this industry i HATE being that kind of person who to call a manager over I understand the other side but they were not very busy I assume their rush is around dinner and we were there from So there could not have been a legit reason as to why she was not giving us good service The manager finally came over again never got a name and us if everything was We to him that we been getting poor service and that we drove from specifically to try this place out He to get us a new server and some The gentleman that eventually took over our table was a lot better we just hate that it was already at the point where we had had enough and to leave Aside from the horrible service our food t that good we for the for two and it t a lot of food And the were trash We went to sixth street after and had a margarita that tasted way better For the this is not very good food Which we t have minded the mediocre food if we had better service from the start When we got our bill we were for everything the the manager brought to us Even after that we were unhappy with our experience and food They t have even taken off the chips and off our bill The only nice thing about this place is the view But there s more to do on lake travis than coming to the oasis Needless to say we felt very unwelcome there by majority of the staff And we will not be backI m from the area and the Oasis to be a go to for sunset The wait is always long the food t exceptional and the have tables so they forget about you If you re willing to push those aside for the view it is wonderful especially at sunset If you have out of they always seem to love itI been going to Oasis for about and my wife and I again on on our wedding anniversary What a huge mistake This place is a death trap The so safety are only in name only and in reality will crowd around you without will come to meet you with their nose out of their The service was also atrocious and I guess they will keep making money because of their monopoly on the view How terribly sad that what could have been an jewel is just a money making irresponsible business with no regard for safetyI ended up here night with my family because there was a hour wait at Flores No wonder there was no wait here at prime eating sunset time I have never in my life been so rushed through a meal Our and in with no chips or Then about later our food still no chips or All our Chicken Chicken and Beef and Cheese are all popular menu and could easily be prepared and ready to serve Me Yes Finally we got after our food and had to ask again for chips Despite the beautiful this was possibly the most unpleasant experience I have had in a long time We all agreed we should have gone to for their Meat and grilled at home for better food with almost as niceTruly amazing that this place cannot serve even fair food I eaten here probably a dozen times since the late s I never had a good meal here Never You could excuse an occasional bad meal but it t matter whether it was lunch or dinner The food always I got married here time in the late s as well We had about people in a comfortable private room No one great food for a wedding but our chicken was inedible for the most part With the excitement of the event and great company I t terribly hungry and t pay too much attention to the lousy food The sunset over the lake was fabulous though My son in law who works in the restaurant business The Oasis a day or two afterwards and politely what was wrong with the meal everything To their credit they gave us a nice refund for the meal later when I that it burned down I the article to my ex wife Like our marriage The Oasis t survive When it was rebuilt I of a new chef and better food I brought some out of town here let s face it there t a better view in the area Alas the food still really I mean you can t even get decent chips and here Chips are usually stale Sad that they been able to keep this sad excuse of a restaurant open only because it such a great location Even more sad is the fact that I probably go again when I want to show off the beauty of Lake Travis to from elsewhere t it be great if they made an effort someday and I t have to brag about the view and apologize for the foodThe food let s get that right out front If you want to eat a quality meal there are other around lake Travis If you want a good meal don t go here But it t stop there The is just plain weird It with the rusty space ship amusement park out front When you go inside there is a mannequin with a head with a sign to the gift shop to it s chest Bizarre If you look to the left of the horse head there is an area set up like someone s uncle s living room The weird uncle not the cool one Various and of stuff are around here Again strange When you go to eat you pass the bar where a s theme is used The behind the bar have paper topping them to keep the out There are tops quality use to do that so here s another big tip off that you are not in a quality establishment So if you want to play or and go through all the many with this place you might have a good time especially if you are drinking heavily Otherwise you should stay away from this restaurant that obviously cost a lot of money to establish but wasted it s potential utterlyHorrible horrible experience here The service Nonexistent We sat for hour before getting to speak to a server then after they our card and we never saw our server again After we decided that we would just leave and ask for our card to be Our card was on the cashier desk mixed in with other random We for a refund and the manager t know how to refund us In the midst of this all a large group of broke into a and someone threw a phone off the balcony In the end we never even got for our order that we NEVER received because all the management left to deal with the police and people involved in the fight This place is horribly and a chaotic mess The view is amazing but it s not worth the headache My advice if you want to go here Go around noon on a weekday or afternoon when it s not busy stay for some and the sunset but plan to get dinner somewhere else as the food t great UPDATE Thankfully we did get our refund about days later however the review will remain star because the whole situation was inexcusable and it ruined our eveningDon t waist your money on expensive Microwave They got rid of the tortilla soup best thing on the menu The food This place can t get any worse meet was cold as could be The broccoli soup had cold in it They are both and like it s from My guess is they have no cook just let the high school that work there make microwave stuff in the back Food is a nightmare Avoid at all The view t even hardly see the lake because of the table below us were not good It s funny that they are to get their to make Get your margarita and eat at the breweryThey raised their tremendously and the quality is awful They no longer offer free chips and Go for the view and eat somewhere elseMy and I went to the oasis a few ago It was a early evening so we knew there would be a wait but we t mind There was a line just to get to the hostess stand When the couple in front of us the hostess we her offer them immediate seating in the bar area next to the restaurant where there was live music or they could wait for a regular table Then when my and I got to her she just handed us a pager and for the name We were both a little out that she t offer us any we probably should have but decided we really t care that much it just very odd We got some and took in the view which was lovely however the place was so busy it kind of took away from the of the view I had a margarita which was really delicious At our table the service was HORRIBLE this was probably the worst service I have ever had Our server was not rude but just very un attentive and slow He never took our drink and never brought us chips and after I saw ALL the table around us with some I him down and for some He took forever to come back over to take our food order and our food took forever to come out By this time the restaurant had down quite a bit I am really understanding if are busy what me was that lack of communication He could have at least come over to apologize for the wait and see if we any but instead he to just ignore us Finally our food and the food was terrible I got the which for around I to be really good I know you pay so much at The Oasis for the view but I do expect a decent meal This however was pretty bad When we were about halfway through with our and clearly still eating the server came over to ask if we any dessert or anything else I usually like to finish my meal before that Finally the night is over and once again we have a long wait for our check only good thing about this place is the view and the However the view you can get at one of the other nearby with much better service and food I have been to Soleil which is excellent I don t know if it is the same or not but it is by far a much better experienceLack of staff in closed sessions for no provided reason It forced inordinately long wait times min hour especially on a It was sundown when we came and we were not able to sit and enjoy the sunset on the lake The place is huge There is no rational even in these times The staff were when the hence this partially poor rating Instead of giving actual they were vague and unfriendly Very unhelpful and very unsympathetic Never got a text that our table was ready even when we had explicitly told the boy he was an absolute awful snoot no name of course our information No help on the matter and we were quickly rushed to a table to make up for the lame we everyone nonsense Management are clear At least some team were nice but again clear lack of direction and hospitality Once seated we came for or we were informed the only had none to our or The menu did not match at all and it to be very poor management of food DONT FOLLOW THE MENU t even bother with We just got up and left we were so disappointed by our treatment If the night could get worse the were disgusting and poorly Nasty and unclean WORSE THAN A GAS STATION We t even enjoy the because of the plastic railing on the lower deck No good at all Not even worth it for the THANK GOD THEY T GET OUR MONEY We came for an experience and they sold none I haven t been so poorly in such a long time Maybe THE WORST Won t be this spot to anyone and we came a long way We came all the way from to experience one of s and we it The from the next door restaurant was nice Love them This restaurant is pathetic and we are all to STAY AWAY the concierge Apparently you can treat like crap since you know they come for the view Thanks for nothingMy wife I were very disappointed with The Oasis at Lake Travis on th We around and finally made it to the check in station the rep told us it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait We registered at knowing that it is usually much shorter and wondering why the Oasis as a business would discourage people trying to obtain their As it turns out we were delighted at to being notify to report to be seated When seated we were several times by our server who acknowledged us and said he would get us soon We also the next table over about the delay in getting their order After and several by this server we left I think this management team is by the COVID crisis and maybe should pull back tables when they are meeting the of theirThe bad Horrendous food Like worse than a hospital cafeteria bad I ordered the shrimp and they were disgusting The shrimp the texture and seasoning They almost boiled or something Soggy and inedible There was no slaw or crisp element like normal fish either The t warm at all and tasted stale Overall I was to eat because I thought I was going to get food poisoning And I was right unfortunately The Service was decent bordering on good We felt taken care of for the most part The good the from this place are This is the only reason this place even in don t even do it justice It s just unfortunate that the food at this establishment is so Because this really could be an outstanding experience especially for people who have never seen the beauty of this state Eat before you come maybe the are good whoWent there yesterday and the food was terrible The wait staff and t great either Drove here from and was excited to eat here because of the for the view The view did not disappoint but the food sure did We will not be coming back here If we do come back we will only be gettingCovid cess pool not Nobody could distance even if you tried in the patio area Furthest available distance was one foot No in line percent capacity When I the manager he rudely informed me it s up to the individual to distance Brewery next door was as bad were a covid gauntlet of Covid breathSome don t know about how to wear a face mask properly food as always Good view and kind of waitress Forgot a few but not aOur hostess took us to the floor and then she that s not where we were suppose to be seated So we back down the flight of and got seated The patio tables look cheap and old there were of chips everywhere on the floor A few of the sun shade were broken We ordered an appetizer but the waiter forgot to bring serving and when we them he took so long to bring them to us I our order and that was a big disappointment as well I ordered the dinner and everything was coldView is great Food is awful Service is not much betterI am SHOOK that the food is so terrible I live from here and will never be This is the second time I have eaten here and both times disappointed You re paying for the view but that s the best I can say The table and are and quite filthy Twice my napkin was on with food The picture is my plate of no joke That s not even the worst part The were not edible and that was not an exaggeration I had to spit it out You re walking a pretty long distance to actually even get there then to wait for a table and come to find out a table for two with no alcoholic us Only who don t know any better come here My advice to anyone visiting is maybe have a couple of for the scenery and get the he out and even then the Oasis brewery is better for thatFirst let me start this review off with the fact that I never made a review on Yelp before unfortunately I felt so strongly about this experience it had to be Also everyone in our group is part of the service industry so we always try to give the benefit of the doubt when go wrong but we most definitely know what to expect when we go eat Walking up everything was absolutely stunning The view was wonderful and the line outside the door was moving very quickly shortly to find out there was a wait Of course it s sunset time we t expect much less We went to the bar and ordered the taste like straight lime juice which we were so disgusted with we sent it back which we felt awful for being those people into waiting to be sat i there was at least open and clean tables on their patio and no one is being seated even though the busser was continually yelling to the host there was clean tables We finally got sat and we had to ask the family next to us to remove their and from our Assuming this table had actually been open long enough for a whole family to put ALL of their belonging on the table came and us and we ordered a tea and water the Chicken appetizer which came as the same time as our meal and before our tea and water Too add to it we did not get the Shrimp that was ordered we got the shrimp We him nicely to fix it so another later we finally got the piece shrimp average rice and we ordered There was no done until the next last second of our meal empty glasses and everywhere even though we them for him trying to help again our whole group was full of We do those later he came back from dropping off our in the dish pit to get our Lastly after all the trouble and apparent misunderstanding from the server I him why if he had up why he t discount our food And yes we were being those people again Knowing myself when I make a mistake on a table I try to make it up to them He told me he t discount a table unless they for one which made me more You can t walk up to your manager and say Hey I up pretty bad and they re a little upset Would you mind their ticket for me After we finally got THAT taken care of walking out we a couple screaming that they re never coming back and we why Apparently this restaurant right after sundown and t serve a couple that flew all the way from to have a nice romantic get away and t serve them at in the evening which is wild I never of such a high end place so early Moral of the story food is to but decently good and the service we got was one I never forget and won t be for next time we make it toWorst service I have ever had The wait staff were rude took forever to take our and t even refill our once The only reason they got a good tip was because there was seven of us so they automatically added gratuity to our bill Food was sub par for the price the view was the only thing pleasant about this experienceand You would think that due to the small menu that the food would be good but honestly it s barely edible On top of that you re paying a ridiculous amount just for the view for fish that were cold and had inside I saw my waitress maybe twice through my meal I ran out of water and t even get a refill until I was about to leave Your best bet is coming for the view taking a couple and leaving without eating Seriously go somewhere elseTourist Trap Worst food in the area I guess they think that because they have this fantastic view that nothing else Until recently I had not been there in and it not in that length of time I will say that the are quite good but are Since it burned down a few ago it been rebuilt to quite garish I won t be back for another Don t say you tThe view is beautiful The view is really the only reason to go It s very expensive and food is gross We really are not a picky family and I get the touristy are usually not great food but this was really disgusting The service is horrible We probably just for someone to come take drink The waitress got attitude because we for a refill She also told us they t add meat to a meal what We got we ordered with no chips I could keep going but you get the point I am so sad this was so bad because we just to area and was to take family when they visit Oh wellFrom a local who away avoid this tourist trap The view is the only thing this place going and they treat you like cattle being led to slaughter and serve hotel quality food The were once pretty good but they now suck as well Go to Lucy s fried chicken much more than chicken or Ranch Steak House for better better food and better service Save your money and aggravationThe view at sunset is a star The service at the bar was a giving this review a star We up to the bar before sunset after waiting none of the three had advanced at the bar so we decided to ditch the and go watch the sunset Thank goodness because when we came back later the same people were still in line We took an out there so decided we to have at least one drink wish we would have just left because it took another to get to the bar Once there we decided we chips and but I was smart enough to ask how long and they told us it would be more that s a big nope I don t think I have ever been to such a slow bar service and I still can t figure out why they were so slow think they might want to rethink how they do the as they are losing a lot of potential money we probably would have had or if the service was plus food Definitely don t need to go backReally disappointed This was supposed to be our last meal in and first time at the Oasis I ahead like before driving there to make sure they were pet friendly Their message came on and said yes we are open We are pet and friendly So we head over to the Oasis We park and take a long walk in the sun with dog and We finally get through the line and get to the hostess We are told they are not pet friendly and t been for No apology no explanation Only an offer to get the manager I m sure it s Covid but still And it would be one thing if you had just made the change but to tell me you have been like that for and t bother the second sentence you hear when you call that is really inconsiderate and irritating We could have if we knew ahead By that time we were already checked out of our hotel with no other So we the long walk back in the sun with and dog and left disappointed and My friend had already eaten there and said the food was mediocre at best We just the experience What a drag Change your message and train your hostess how to properly interact when you have just ruined a whole family s plan We won t be back but it would be a shame to lose more over something completely fixable that should have been done agoRude Nice view They have nice but Better aroundHorrible experience People are extremely rude Food is expensive for what you get Everything is in plastic One star for the beautiful view otherwise that place zero',\n",
       " 2.0: 'The food was boring flavorless and uncreative I known year to make better tasting Ordered a thinking it would be a safe drink to go with Ended up with a glass full of sprite lemon juice Tasted like juice instead of a real drink The only reason I even gave it any was because of the view The view was amazing If I this place again it would be for only and the view And even then I t spend more than an hour at the placeBeautiful beautiful That s about the only reason to come here The drive up is also pretty nice Looking for delicious food You won t find it here We ordered the as an appetizer Who thought and a can of would taste and look better than the here It honestly like a bowl of runny cheese soup I also ordered the Grilled Shrimp as an entree Five shrimp wrapped in bacon with a sliver of for almost Yeah not falling for that again This place is on the side and totally not worth it I guess what you re paying for is the viewI haven t been to the Oasis in over showing my age Excited to take my two teenage We t have to wait for a table on a afternoon so I was We about for a waiter to take our drink order and ordered cheese dip The dip came out later no drink Took another for We ordered food for the table and First of all the are huge The food is mediocre at best Chicken is dry and tasteless were to our table cold Will probably be another before I go back But that view Best thing about this place is the view I recommend a cocktail and chips Eat dinner elsewhereMan with such a great location and view you d think these people could figure out how to make some good food and find some good Every time we go we continue to take people who visit from out of town for the view the food is and the service is Too bad this place could be really awesomeFamily and went to The Oasis after many nagging telling me how nice it is and the are amazing We ended up going the place is great as far as the view the waiting time was it did not take long We got and taken to a room in the floor where in my opinion was the worst location ever other than the view The food was horrible did not like the taste of it and so were my nagging that were me to go there for so many times I gave it Star just for the viewThe view is stunning but if you re in the sun when it s F and their umbrella don t fold that far then good luck to you The food and drink is lousy You re paying for the view I had an over spiced with sickly sweet chicken My husband had too sweet and cold Buyer bewareThe Oasis on Lake travis a great level patio and is a huge place and when we were there it was We were seated immediately but it took them to bring us glasses of water and chips were quickly buzzing by but no to check on us The food was mediocre and the were sky high and way fast food would have been better tasting and The were as expensive as Lake Travis area is nice and the Oasis great but that s all it Bottom line come for the maybe for a drink but save your stomach and your wallet from eating at this placeCome for the view and stay for the food No wait on second thought don t stay for the food I m not from but every time I am in town this is a MUST STOP And it s not because of the food I mean you don t have to read far into my review to know this Just seeing the average rating will be sufficient But stick around for the rest just for and So like I was saying every time I bring family or to we always come for the amazing view of the sunset There is always a long wait around this time The food at first was decent but this last time we came last month the chicken was so dry and flavor Tasted like a rubber chicken The cool thing is you get a free souvenir Get to take the plastic cup in which your drink comes in Who t like a free souvenir Will I come again I m not going to lie and say I won t just because that view is hard to come by But I will definitely not be the again Maybe an appetizer onlyView was great but food was mediocre We to wait over for a table they do not take and on from the bar while we However both only had one bartender and we had to stand in line over to get a drink The were fair and were in regular glasses unlike when we sat down to eat Then the were in small plastic and were watered down Our never and waitress while polite was by the number of tables she was responsible for Would recommend if you go just have chips and enjoy the vieware great service and food not so much Took to finish dinner Had a party of Which TIP is put on bill do not have to work for it We were told large table top are after smaller tables The waitress said there was nothing she could do If we ever go back we will eat first Lesson learnedThis place is a Chi Chi s on let s just hope they never have a Hepatitis A outbreak Went here on a recommendation from a friend and this is probably the last time I ever take advice from that friend This is NOT a romantic restaurant I don t care HOW lovely the view of the Lake Travis is If I have to take a golf cart across the parking lot b c it s so big this T a place I want to share a few s Likely a great place to bring your b c no one will notice them screaming they can draw on the tables and might even get picked to ring the bell at sunset NOBODY attention to that and I was told it was a HUGE deal You can t miss the hostess stand it like an air traffic control station You can t miss the bar there are about in front of it The was fine nothing special but nothing great either I will say that considering the amount of people in the place service was than The food was fine but definitely not worth the money You re better off just out the sunset on the The rest of the atmosphere t make the trip worth itOnly great thing about this place is the view I was greatly disappointed with the food and the service We got seated almost immediately Our waiter was really nice but we were there for not because we to everything just took a long time to get to our table The food was cold meat was dry were averageI only give this place two because of the view it s its only quality We been here a few times and have always left rather unsatisfied because of the mediocre food and slow service We decided to give it another shot today since the weather is gorgeous and we had some time to spare for the drive out we live downtown When we up we if it was even open the place like a ghost town However we were met by a couple of cheerful one of whom sat us outside There were only tables that were counting our own We decided on our over the menu a few times decided on our food our and saw both were dirty Gross We for about total and decided to leave because at this point we still t been seen by anyone on the This was the last straw for us and we likely not go back The Oasis needs to step up their game big timeThe food leaves a little to be desired and the are sky high But the view and the atmosphere are the saving grace for this place My and I tend to eat somewhere else and catch sunset and a cocktail here and be on our way This place could be and should be so much more I know that it is no easy task to make good food for this many people but when your price point is so high and your location so popular you should be able to find the kitchen staff you need to make delicious food I can say that I would for sure spend a lot more money at this place if the food quality were higherHave to say that even though it is beautiful out here the food is still just not up to par for the price I got the Atlantic salmon which I highly recommend but my got the pork The had so much cinnamon in them it was bizarre Please oasis hire betterNot the best food but amazing The service is spotty and its worst on I appreciate The beautiful seating and outdoor and they the live music bye and nightsGreat view Nothing else was great Most of all the service t split the check t serve a certain side because it t on the menu even though it was with a specific dish Place was empty but service was still excruciatingly slow Food was great or terribleThe two are for the amazing view Horrible food HORRIBLE serviceA great place to eat pub food But please don t order fish They were really bad and so fishy I even told then and they did not even offer me a discount or take them off my meal Bad customer service in my opinionFood is just gross Bland and very few Almost like a school cafeteria The wait is always long and by long I mean at least hour on the It is nice to be the lake but that is about it If you must go because someone told you that If you are in you MUST go to the Oasis then eat before hand and just browse around the many different and they have added lately There are multiple that you get to see the nice view and you don t have to eatVery lovely setting The only people in the party to have had upset stomach within Food is below par is very salty was and chips goodbecause of the view Food was not good Not fresh Lots frozen food Food not worth it But if you want to get some with a nice view then goodI only give this restaurant for the view of the lake The food was nothing to be excited about and the staff t take our drink order for before one of the two male acknowledged us After taking our drink he was quick to leave before taking our appetizer order When our drink and appetizer were brought to us later forgot one of the It took him an additional to bring the drink to the table The appetizer was was overly seasoned with onion but lime to it made it tolerable I ordered chicken with For a restaurant that is as I was highly disappointed in the Oasis getting this meal wrong especially the tomato paste overly onion flavor and chew they gave for a tortilla I would not recommend eating at the Oasis Maybe if you want the view and have it might be worth itThe The view is amazing and the air off the lake it cool and breezy Live music on The The place is outrageously gaudy and ostentatious especially for From the of the construction the owner to build it up even bigger and better The food and are for the so so quality and the place Horrible floor for dancing The verdict I met cool people there and the people watching is great but I won t be a regularThis is a place that by on its By I mean the view of the lake The food as far as goes is sub par Not worth it if you are looking for good food The are t stand out either The wait staff is attentive I don t have anything bad to say about them I ordered the which chicken Everything was just thrown on top which for can be normal yet it t work for them I also ordered the shrimp and chicken The chicken was bland and the shrimp tasted as if they were just sprinkled with salt pepper and something spicy I a lot more for the price taste wise and locationWhy is that when get big their service so much I haven t been to the Oasis in several but today was by far my worst experience here The server was on our table as soon as we sat down wanting to know what we to drink Before we ever had a chance to read the menu When I for a few more we t see her again for another We ordered our and and the up well before the The strawberry margarita my girl friend order was wrong when it was finally The service had but no Thought for a I was on an flight somewhere The bill up without the server ever if there was anything else we And we re still waiting for the complimentary chips and If you want a really poor dining experience this is the place to go If not I d steer way clear of this placeReally bad food Got a salad and everything was cold the plate since apparently it was made several and kept in the Really didnt feel fresh The view was amazing though and the water had freeFood was good I had better but still good The view is amazing Love the over look of Lake Travis Service on the other hand me want to never visit here again Unfriendly staff not rude but also not welcoming Other tables to be and were not throughout the duration of my stay For the price you pay the service by far Beautiful place to bring someone on a date Maybe you get lucky with a better waiter waitressThis place gone downhill significantly The view is fantastic at sunset which is unfortunately by bad food and mediocre very little selection The shopping area around it is largely abandoned and up The restaurant itself like the maintenance is Just not worth the drive On a high note the balloon lady made some amazing for our and the golf cart were funThe food was rice good Hatch chili not so much Service was really bad Never got at all and our waitress was just lostOn June th our family The Oasis after my nephew s high school graduation My sister had been a few and was very I was not at all with anything but the view Service was horrible the food was horrible and our waitress was very rude to me I saw her roll her several times We went around with a party of Since they don t take we at wait of at least To our surprise we were back after only The waiter put four top tables together and to fit very large around them He then got another four top and us to sit with our They were going to add another table but that would have had some of us partially blocking the door leading out to the balcony Finally another waiter decided to have us move to another section we just had to wait for them to put those tables together and clear it off It ended up being about before we were seated Once we were seated no one came by to take our drink order for quite awhile After our drink order was we sat there ready to order not looking a and almost for our waitress to come back Our waitress did not offer drink to our end of the table we had to request them She t clear away any empty glasses or To her credit she did cater to the other end of the table quite nicely and with a nice attitude Not sure why she t do the same for those of us at the other end The food came out fast that s about the only good thing I can say about that I ordered the Red Fish with rice and The fish was over and dry the mainly of barely and a few small of broccoli and inedible asparagus The butter lime sauce on the side was downright nasty Just to make sure it t me I had my sister taste the fish and the sauce and watched her grimace I was able to eat some of the fish only because I was hungry The rice t bad but was quite bland In my opinion the only thing this place to offer is the amazing view If you re just going to sit on the patio at sunset have some and take in the view you probably enjoy itthe food here is not why you d come to this spot The setting is why you come here Great spot to bring out of for the perfect sunset and that s about itWhy does have to boast this place Why do people from out of town go here and think this is what to offer It me I live here and have for sometime I only been twice and it s been a drag both times The food is horrific the place is a ghost town and the t that great My last waiter was great the previous one not so much As everyone it s all about the view and maybe some music I do not think it s worth the trip out there and I don t think that people from out of town should even try There are SO many other to eat that will knock you over AVOIDThe view we had Lake Travis was exceptional The food I ordered the Tao s and was not The meat was tasteless It had some type of in there but it was just bitter The view almost made it worth it though Almost Also they are not able to split What I have never of a restaurant establishment not a system capable of splitting They need to speak with their credit card processorLocation Location Then everything is downhill from there at the bar on wait staff and management obviously been told that there are no for more help There was a line to get in and then an actual line at the bar and they don t have chips easily accessible like s does Now onto the food it s edible I m sure that t people are nice but they re put in a tough positionTook family here on the holiday for New in It took quite a while to be seated about but I get that on a nice warm day when people are off work and are still in town The problem was that after being seated it took for me to complain that we t been to and t even received water yet The manager came out and gave but no apology Here s what you do if you are down in staff due to and call close of the dining room therefore keeping it to a level that you can handle can decide if they want to wait to be seated but after being seated they should receive great serviceThe ambience is spectacular the food really my wife ordered with The were over and the plate was over flowing with The service was really bad as well we for about until someone finally came to our table to get our drink orderWe two to be seated When they finally came to bring us to our table they us to a super dark corner where there was no light and I t even have been able to see my food I got pretty because I t wait two to sit at a table like that when we them if we can sit at a table with light they said no they cannot do that We were because every restaurant we ever had any they always are quick to fix it They had a lot of empty tables so not sure what that long wait was for After for a few they finally agreed to put us at a different table The service t bad the lady was sweet and gave us good The food was below mediocre Save yourself some money this place is allI the oasis last with some in The line to get a table was very long The wait was two in a half When we were finally seated they brought out chips and dip which was good Everyone put in their then everyone s except mine I had to wait almost for my meal by the time my food I lost my appetite an took my meal to go The service was slow an bad The only good part of the oasis is the view of the water that s the only reason this review received twoI hate when overcharge for bad food just because of their gem of a location To me it s a waste of space Food is an art and it s a privilege to feed people I would never eat here againVery food Basically you are just paying for the view I got the cheese how on earth do you make them tasteless Shortly after taking a couple of I got sick and spent the rest of my time running to the ladies room I to swap a patty with the regular patty but they waitress said that the kitchen t be able to handle it I d have to just order what Was on the I with the regular So basically Add cheese swap out the add this and that Why could the kitchen do that but not just switch out the I had a St Rita to drink which was fineGreat view but utterly the worst food I have ever tried to eat Skip the meal and enjoy the view with a drinkThe only quality of this restaurant is the view The food is mediocre and the service is poor and inattentive The process for is odd and inefficient Overall this is a huge tourist trap By eating at the Oasis you will be missing out on the many incredible in My suggestion is that if you must go there to enjoy the phenomenal view then just grab some at the bar and then find somewhere else to eatI won t make this very long because everything I have to say about the Oasis already been said in the other Although I was sad when it burned down a few ago it t the food I was sorry about it was the view I thought once they re that they d want a fresh start I guess not The view is as great as ever but the food is borderline bad The are but are way and in plastic souvenir Lastly service is friendly but slow slow than slow The only time I ever go to The Oasis is when someone is in town who t previously It certainly a lot better than the drive from the airport to downtown If all you ever saw of was the airport and your hotel you d think was ugly For those of us that live in this fine town avoid The Oasis unless you absolutely must take in the viewThis restaurant such an awesome view that at first you be The people running this place think this great view and setting are enough to bring people in and it s really if the food Unfortunately we all do care about the FOOD TOO because it t free or cheap I ordered the vegetarian They turned to be plain weird This place is supposed to be but the enchilada was nothing like it It had broccoli and some soggy thrown into a wet blanket of a tortilla The sides rice and were good The vegetarian garden was another sad sight The actually came as bread with a patty in between The server was just too busy to ask us if we or dessert Poor guy Something sinister about a pleasant afternoon that almost no member of the staff was smiling But if you do go there the and the lake will give you good companyWe all know that one of the best in is at the Oasis And we have known that this beautiful view does not come with the best food We are willing to give up the quality of food for the atmosphere But tonight my first visit in a while the amount of food was also a problem I had the shrimp The were nothing special but the serving of rice was honestly about three and the dish of was maybe half full Our server was very good and a applaud his pleasant attitude So I go again when all I want is to be with and have a drink Come on Oasis treat us like you want us to come back and EATWe have gone here a few times mostly for the view Have never been super with the food but service always been goodThe view was good The service was slow our food was cold and our were Very very very dry The waiter did not come by a lot to refill our water after trying to chew and Swallow the dry meat We ate outside because of the view and there were all over Not going there for food for sure next timeThis place is so It is one of the best to take people out to see the hill country but the service is mediocre at best Last night it was terrible It was later in the evening so business had Seated within then took forever to get someone to wait on us After the order it was when i the over to cancel our order Just then the food came out Two salad and fish RidiculousWe have been going to the Oasis for over At one point a few back the food and service where getting better than its history Went last weekend for lunch For of us is was about without alcohol The food was just not good service was weak I had a it was but nothing to write home about I did have to laugh about the fact the and mustard came out in The same kind of that Sonic and other fast food provide A in the group ordered the his were he had better do I have to finish these they are just not any good Extremely with mediocre food and poor service Go for a drink with the view and eat elsewhere This place t survive as a restaurant without the viewGreat view of an sunset but the food is and not all that good Recommend a beer and the sunset thoughI saw the star rating before so I had braced myself for the awful service and terrible food that I knew was to come We went here looking solely for a few and a nice view That was my only expectation And did The Oasis manage to screw it up Upon entering we very specifically but very politely the hostess for a table right up against the railing as we to enjoy the view We added that if none were available at the moment we would be more than happy to wait It was mid afternoon there were ample tables available of This was not an unreasonable request The hostess acknowledged that request then promptly us to a table nowhere near a railing underneath a fan and between four other tables We at her slightly confused then still very politely said I m sorry I must have been we would like a table against a railing so that we can enjoy the view With this the hostess audibly the down on the crap table and us now she to walk all the way back up and ask her manager where else she can put us Then she leaves there and off After a few we wonder we re supposed to be doing and we trek back up the to find her on the phone with manager clearly very put out that we really do want the scenic table we her for the first time and we t making a joke She caught us her attitude and promptly took us to a railing table like we originally for we her and she bounded off to give her attitude to the next poor patron So we now had our lovely table the lake What a view fantastic A bus boy brought chips and which were not good but they re chips and and I m of the opinion that even bad chips and are pretty good In a few our server and took our order While he t very about his job he t outright awful either We put our order in and a should be safe The server took our empty basket of chips at this time promising a refill A few later a brought our We that we had no chips and he to be right back with some We And we We watched the congeal and get hard on the top And then our sigh We told the who brought the to just take the back that we never received any chips to eat it with and now the had He did so without any comment at all The and t terrible they were about what you d expect at an No one got sick thank god And that s about all I can say of the food Our actual server returned after we d finished eating and off the bill He t ask how it was if he could bring us anything else We t get a refill on the beer or we d ordered water never did get the chips His only remark was that he took the off our bill as Well that was big of him Pay the bill and f you very much So the whole experience was right on par with the other Yelp Crap service crap food stunning view Is the view worth it though Nope Won t be back not for all the great inThe food eh The good The view I would recommend anyone go eat at another restaurant in this plaza for the view and sunsetI been here times now Once as a tourist and twice since we here The atmosphere and view is awesome What a waste of good real estate I keep that it was just a bad day but the food is marginal at best and this is coming from a HUGE fan of bar food No food snob here The other thing is no happy hour That to me we don t want local business I live away and would come on a regular basis but never again unless we are looking to show someone visiting a good view and are just As far as service we had good and bad Today was good I sincerely hope they take these seriously because I for one would love to become a regular if change for the betterStill thinking about those I had and not because they were great but because they were definitely sub par Like everyone is saying this place is about the view and the Not the service not the food The chicken chips and are all right Would not recommend the the meat is not great neither are the They our group of at a table for They don t take either They re not hurting for business because this place is crazy so it s doubtful they will ever address anything they need to improveUnfortunately the service is very bad and this is something that we did not expect from a place with this reputation Also the group at the entrance behind the I do not think they have any experience in dealing with Customer service and we just notice that from the way they were talking to us But the spectacular view was worth the minute wait THE VIEW IS PRICELESSEverything they say is true the FOOD IS HORRIBLE I normally don t care enough to write but seriously DO NOT ORDER ANY FOOD HERE The view is BEAUTIFUL enjoy it but whatever you do do not eat here Come for come for the free chips and order the the only good thing on the menu I read some before going and was but still did not listen We ordered the Red Fish and it was HORRIBLE it was dry and hard the rice that came with it had no taste and the were oddly did not go with the dish at all and tasted like they were straight from a can I know we should of have it but I thought given the higher price of the dish it might be better quality Complete waste of money the entire dish was inedible We also ordered the Tuna Salad it was edible but not worth the price we for it The was pretty good but also over priced There is no way this place t know their food it almost as if they are so busy they don t want to serve food they know people will still come for the alcohol and the view Also the s bathroom was disgusting There was trash all over the floor were out of order and it was just big busy mess The service was also terrible our waitress kept disappearing for at a time We came on a right before sunset at around p m but the place was still She us and said she would be right back to take our drink came back after we gave her our dinner and she came back later with chips and We t see her again for about when she brought our food We thought she was busy given how busy it was but then we could spot her talking to other nonchalantly as if we t just ask for the dessert menu She forgot to bring the menu but at this point the sun had already set we t want the food we ordered never mind anything else and we just to leave We cash and left so we t have to wait for her to charge the card and bring it back another later If you are hungry do not come here If you want to enjoy a breath taking view over and don t mind bad service this is the placeThe food here is very I think they use the same red sauce for every dish with no particular flavor accent I know the Oasis is a Lake Travis landmark but if you re trying to give your guest a great view there are better with the same view in the new development right next to the Oasis Do yourself a favor and check out some of the other next time you re out hereGo here once for the bring your camera take leave and never go back again This is the quintessential tourist trap Lake view commanding view of the but totally vapid in all other that make only faint at providing service alcoholic so weak the need not bother with issuing them a license and uninspired tasteless food totally devoid of substance You pay through the nose for the photographic opportunity in essence In summary Atmosphere View of Lake Travis and Service star Quality star Value star Taste star Charitably twoThere are always those staple Central you have to check off the list Sadly we used my birthday dinner out to check the Oasis off the list and it was a sorry disappointment The margarita was like lemonade the sub par and the atmosphere besides the view was depressing Would love for someone to come in and revamp this place with the quality foodThe thing about the oasis is the food is not good Thats right I said it The food You are paying outrageous of money for the view and creepy that sit outside and are throughout the place I will say their view is amazing and is a great place to take out of towner s as long as they don t think this is how all are like The food is really bad and the place is worked by a bunch of high school If you live in take someone from out of town once but then don t waste your night at this placeI feel like this place is the first stop on the What to do in guide book The food was as were the But this sprawling complex would be nothing without the view So that up for a lot of itsAll they really have going for them is their location If you are going for be fore they only have house slushy or a completely one They have only one selection of tequila but yet they are supposed to have food The said there was supposed to have the ability to do call ahead seating That was not when we Finally the other issue is that we had a group of people and the restaurant to divide our tabThis area is growing fast The last time I was here there was of construction to build surrounding business and parking The scenic view is definitively breath taking The food not so great t that hard to make so I don t understand why it t be better The customer service is decent not much to complain about there This place can get extremely so if you plan on catching the sunset for dinner outside in the patio you should plan ahead and arrive hour or so before sunset Otherwise you would miss the aurora on Lake TravisGreat view Over priced food Food is like s Service but you can tell they are not to work there Dirty make this a great place to have a beer and look at the view Salad I had had and cut in a square pattern on a plate Just like a diner in the dessert oasis Fish were good so told tortilla soup was like of of can with pork in it very poor Hamburger was dry and tasteless Silverware was the stuff on planet Would only go there for view and beer gone way downhillThe food t that good They took forever to give out check and it just t the experience I don t think I will be coming backThe view of the lake was excellent The food and service were not so much Our server like he t to be there Long story short left my case at the table which had my prescription glasses in it Went back for it a few later and the server if he saw them and he just basically me and told me to go ask the Hostess How can you not see something that was left on the table just a few ago while he was the one cleaning the table This place is definitely a tourist trap for sure for the lake viewThe service was HORRIBLE I took my mother there for Day and we over an HOUR after we sat down to get our food Not to mention we watched other and tables get faster and with more service The view is pretty amazing and the atmosphere is pretty nice Just expect incredibly poor service and rudeWent there for lunch to avoid the dinner wait we had about The view was fantastic Food was only The server only came to check on us three times between sitting and leaving Had to get up and refill twice from a pitcher that was left down the way from our tableThis place is really The food is not that great and it s really really over priced You re totally paying for the view The best view is during sunset but the level of how this place during sunset is CRAZY This is one of those do it once maybe twice and you re over it kind ofthe Perfect Margarita t make my stomach ache too many sweet fruity sugary on the menu Our server like a lazy took our order checked in on us once gave us the check he was M I A the rest of the time We sat inside due to the weather and had to deal with a group of screaming ladies at the bar This is not a family friendly place especially for that get easily Food was gross good thing we only ordered pretty sure was a can of tasted like freezer food We sat inside to escape the heat but an annoying group of ladies were getting at the bar screaming yes all over the place After our snack we went exploring on the back patio and to end up at the patio of the closed restaurant next door We took some great there and our journey We might come back for the view but nothing moreThis review is based on my visit there which only included and From what I the food is horrible so most people go for the view and stick with the or We went on a cool foggy day so it t crowded We were seated immediately and ordered with chips and I had a margarita on the that was decent It t the best one I never had but I it The chips and was tasty but again nothing special I see why people typically only visit for the view Our server was pleasant and reasonably attentive Overall it was good experience just nothing spectacularThe most tourist y place in that way that way You pay for the view of course No other reason to go there The service is good The food is The are You check that box then you don t go back until you have more out of townGo for the view live music upstairs and have a few DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FOOD LIKE FOOD FROM Our group went twice thinking maybe the second time would be better assuming it was a bad chef that day or simply ordered the wrong we were wrongI read previous and kept thinking the food t be THAT bad but sure enough it was god awful Service was almost as bad as the food You know what it s not even worth rating for food Just go for the view and some and eat something somewhere elseAfter spending the morning at the lake which is amazing by the way I was taken to The Oasis for lunch but not to expect much in the food front but the are amazing On arrival it was busy but we booked out slot and told a min wait and you are when your table becomes available I did like that much better than a buzzer to tell you We had a table outside and have to say the view was amazing and that you can t fault at all I could spend most of the day just sitting there and looking out at that lake There was a good choice on the menu and as hungry we ordered and a main to keep us going for the afternoon Whilst the came out quickly the food t and as the main was a salad that was a bit of a shock and people around us who ordered after us received their mains first that did seem a little strange The food itself was rather bland with no real flavour to it and whilst the chicken was ordered for the salad it was warm at best the best part of the salad was the pecan which t saying much Overall not the best place I have been to and would recommend for the view and as a one off treatThe food is over priced and really bad like watery ketchup straight out of a jar and the meat was badly and seasoned The were premium but the meal was not even Cabana quality The service was also pretty bad No one at our table of what they ordered The The reason this place away with terrible food and service is the appeal of its amazing location If you want a drink or two on the patio by all enjoy it But if you want a quality meal you had best look elsewhereThis place is great if u want a nice place to chill and out w ur or family Great Our hostess was awesome She was fun and energetic Try the perfect w the raspberry peach and the dip this t some fancy star place but a nice place to chill and enjoy the view not great food but good water viewI typically don t care to write negative but I felt like doing so would be somewhat of a Stopped by for a late lunch just to enjoy the view sip some good and have some The service was No welcome to The Oasis no smile no nothing really Seated with our party of and about and still no one came by Had to flag down someone to send someone over Waitress came and did not introduce herself or even smile whatsoever Then about another later waiter came and said he would be our new waiter and I literally thank god the last gal was not happy or friendly whatsoever Food was at best were good though I think they just need better training and direction Bunch of and even more just standing around but no one really actually being attentive With a reputation as a place to take tourist or out of to see y all really need to step it upon the view alone but the food is about as good as a cabana which Could be so much more it used to have a beautiful waiting room but now cheaply made jewelry like a cheap resort The service is this styleI want to like their food I really do but it still I kept hearing radio that they got a new chef yeah that t help the food at all It s still food and We went this past weekend and on of and for person The view is amazing and it s a gorgeous venue restaurant If you happen to be unlucky to end up out there on a day when there is no sun or sunset I hardly think it s worth the trip They are more and more out there too which I really dig and is why I am giving the in my review The and the beauty of the place are it s It s a place i d go every so often or to catch a show if they have a good band but I t frequent the place There are other on the lake with much better food that still have decent It s a shame that this amazing view and gorgeous establishment can t seem to serve better food andI don t understand the four and five star Am I missing something here The food can only be as frozen terrible and way Went with a group of after a day on the lake The only decent were the view and chips and I t drinking but tasted a margarita and it was sickly sugary and watered down No one was able to finish their We ordered since we were was decent and the chicken were good The steak on the was chewy and tasted frozen and gross We finally were able to order and it took awhile for the food to arrive No big deal since we were a big group Two people got fish and said they were so gross they t take another bite One person t even finish the Three of us ad the chicken sandwich The chicken was chewy and tasted like a frozen thing out of a bag No one in our group finished their meal or had good to say Another girl and myself were also sick and threw up afterwards Maybe come for a couple and enjoy the view but I would skip the food Its absolutely not worth the high price tagLet me premise this by saying I HATE so my visit was pretty from the beginning This place is very lively Parking is a challenge as it s inadequate Only get from the first floor bar never the restaurant Most to really enjoy the live band and of the lake Definitely a tourist trap but not in a bad way Little to Grandma s and Grandpa s were on the dance floor which was fun to watch We tried to find someplace to sit which was rather difficult Not because of the limited seating but because ALL of the tables were disgusting Apparently they t until someone down Not my kind of place so I won t be back but would definitely recommend a visit at least onceFood was not good at all the view was to die for service was good and the manager was on top of everything and took care of us but the food was not good at all the fish tasted like it was the was tough and not seasonedThe only reason I d give two to Oasis is for the spectacular of the lake The food however is pitifully sub standard and a waste of money It s really tragic that a restaurant with such a fantastic location completely the ball in the kitchen The ownership obviously chosen to take advantage of the tourist crowd and little value on what should matter most the food What a wasteThe are for the view That is it It can take two for a table the food is never the appropriate temperature and the are awful You would think that after all the money they spent on they would try to improve the food or at least theA beautiful spot that to have become a tourist trap The service is lousy and the food is average The view is the only thing to go for It s worth out once but that s itWe decided to have a th birthday party here and we had a party of approximately people so we two in advance It was a surprise party so we were trying to set it up as a surprise but of course they have a strict no seating policy until the entire party is there They said they would seat us as soon as all of party except the birthday boy was there so we could get seated set up which was better than nothing Well it t work They around on where to seat us and when they finally sat us someplace where we could see the water they t fit us all and we had to be split up To add insult to injury they sat us next to their fancy port o which are basically lipstick on a pig so we got the awesome smell of sewage all night We are all to the area so we all were well aware of the fact that the food is so so and expensive We went there for and the scenery which is the best The Oasis can offer and they to ruin that for us too I know they brag about being able to seat people at once but they are definitely NOT all good Experience at least once to say that you did but if they start taking you out past the patio bar to the right even if you already an hour save yourself additional frustration and wait a little longer for another table The food is already bad enough the sewage smell will make it pretty much unbearable Oh yeah and they closed at on a If you have a party with that like to out and talk and drink go somewhere elseOverall quirky Family Restaurant with an amazing view although the food was decent it was extremely hot when I went but I the I had steak and grilled shrimp I t anything amazing but for the price it to match up to the restaurant Juicy meat and shrimp but could be marinated or better in of flavor Sadly since it was hot my waiter t ever refill my water but it s possible they just don t give Cute plastic cup and really nice little outside of the restaurant Local record shop outside to check that outThe was hotter than the cold shrimp and were good Someone turning the off while I m in the bathroom was not fun I don t know what to say that s been the last of my time here so farMy husband and I had celebrated our st year anniversary and ago at The Oasis Since then the place had burned down going through many and additional add on Since we we decided that why not go there for our anniversary for nostalgia Our were low based upon of this place and sadly they were correct We here on a early evening and barely the place due to all the additional and The place is surrounding by small Oasis brewery parking garage Basically the Oasis turned into some weird beachy tourist trap It was odd to see all these outside of the oasis It was like someone up I later learned it was due to some store that was selling them or something Moving on into the Oasis there was a small wait to get a table since they t have enough to accommodate the influx of people trying to grab a bite to eat Once we were led down of we landed at our small table I got the Oasis Sunset drink which was decent tasting and got me a nice buzz Their hurricane are a minimum of per person My husband got the spicy banana drink He said it was good but got overwhelmingly sweet towards the end of it We were given a huge basket of chips and to munch on while we for our food Our food came out very shortly after we ordered it It was weird since normally you wait a little bit for and it was also kind of busy For our main meal we got the for two people We got shrimp chicken corn cheese sour cream rice The food was but we were hungry so we ate what we The service was not great We saw our waitress only a few time throughout the meal I don t even think she checked in on us after we got the food I would recommend if you feel the need to come here come for the view beautiful and an hurricane drinkWell I never thought that I would find myself here ever again but sometimes when you find yourself you just have to suck it up and prepare for another uninspiring two star experience So what since Well the whole Oasis Temple of Doom much much bigger now I don t think the restaurant itself was any bigger but now there s a lot more stuff in and around their complex I at least one other eatery a coffee shop almost up an extra star just for that probably if I had kept looking around I could have found even more maybe tattoo pawn who Once seated inside I noted that the menu much smaller than when I had last just a small handful of run of the mill I guess this sense given the dismal of the food why try to be terribly innovative if no one is going to be happy anyway were good though For the life of me I don t think that I will ever get the appeal of this place come out here to date propose have wedding yet I find the Oasis to be barely more romantic and classy than or But we did make it to sundown this time was beautiful to see in the brief when our view t by cameraBad food Expensive Slow service Good liquor Very pretty sunset Tourist trapTourist place beautiful view of lake Travis and stunning view during sunset Normally a long line in weekend I an hour and half to get sit it Because is really busy so server have a really difficult time to serve us We got our drink and some chips no one checked on us again until minute later when our entree came out You want to know about their food I think star rating should it allThe Oasis only draw the view and the view is worth enduring the rest It s really a shame that they took such a wonderful spot and put so little effort into making it really fantastic I mean it s probably the biggest profit margin they way they re operating right now but it would make a difference to the whole community if they to a higher level of excellence Anyway the food is fairly mediocre The service from mildly good to pretty bad I never personally had the margarita but my lunch dinner have and I never anything good about them Really some people would probably pay the cost of a meal here just to sit and watch the sunset without any food so as far as worth it value this place is pretty decent I m still sticking with because I m upset by the waste of such a spectacular and unique piece of dirtThe food and service here t the best I ordered the salmon platter and the presentation was nice but the taste was old and unsettling The salmon tasted very and the crab were just over sweeten The scenery is amazing but the atmosphere was flat Not the best place for food My recommendation is to get some chips andFood really and so did the service I had the fish which were wildly The rice was terrible as well It tasted like one those second Uncle Ben s Also the appetizer is literally melted with bland pico de mixed in Just so you know they don t do any and they don t split Cook at home or hit up Bell You will be much happier I m giving and of them are for the viewGreat view but pretty mediocre food for the price Made my stomach hurt Place is and carpet in the restaurant Gross Other nice in the Oasis with the same viewThe view was delicious scrumptious mouth watering delectable and titillating Food no so much for bland Would fly in the North but not down here starPoor service over priced and food nice scenic outlook are in a plastic cup and watered down Red Fish and Shiner Bock Pork for main were average tasting Waitress t really around t ask us for and had to grab her attention to get some water Too bad the management t pay attention to the about the service tip dinner for family of I expect better service all around t feel like leaving a tip but I m not impolite At least the family photo turned out niceHow did this place go from being a star to maybe three then all of a sudden four star No way come try the food you will be quite by the mediocrity of it however the view is spectacular No beer on tap but do treat yourself by going upstairs to the oasis brewery for some of the in Too bad they have not figured out how to get the beer downstairs Do you really want go into or better yet find the food truckTerrible service soso food over priced The sunset can only overcome so much Don t waste your time orThe view is fantastic but both the food service was very disappointing My salad was but the rest of our table we were total all about their food my who had ordered It s very sad that such a great spot does not have quality food service This could be s gem but sadly management think that view alone make a restaurant great If I go again it will only be forI rarely give any but this time I just can t resist I love The Oasis The server last night was The music was great the view the people all that BUT PLEASE for the love of GOD y all need to improve in your Kitchen I have been plenty of times to The Oasis and the food is just Horrible I had the last night and been all day with an upset stomach cold as a and the were raw and tasted like they were three days ago My son had which he could not pass I tried them and agreed completely NO flavor at all just as if they had no seasoning was also so watered down All in all it was a foul ball again and a total disappointment to all of us I will continue visiting The Oasis because it other to offer but I think I give up on the food SorryThe only reason to put up with the awful service and bad food is the view Go to Hula Hut or Ranch Steak House instead Be ready to stand in line at the bar for half hour to get a drink while you wait some more for a table Rude say snippy and seat other before you while they say you re next We so much longer than what they said and the sunset anyways The server made on the food Fan blowing right on our and they t turn it off Just unplug it yourself Never take or you will be embarrassed by the treatmentThis is an easy one You go to the Oasis one time in your life to enjoy the beautiful sunset Then you never go back Because the food is awful the service on a really good day is mediocre and why should you support an establishment that really t care about their but just your The sad irony is if they just stepped it up it could be world famous but for now it is just known as the restaurant you go to in with the pretty sunset but just don t eat the food for mother nature s sunset gloryCame here after a while on the lake with our two sons for Father s Day We enjoy the view and food so it was in our However once and for a table outside The hostess brought us my husband me and our two down to the most level and in a small corner table We dealt with the of but as our hostess was us to our table she a dirty napkin left behind on the table and food off our table before trying to sit us there We did not like that Sitting us at a dirty table that you to clean with a dirty napkin the left behind So we a different table and my husband for the one next to it as he to eat a lot She said the table was for We were So my husband to seat somewhere else so we back up the of and finally she sat us at a table at the top The table was good From there it took our waiter just to even meet us and an extra to bring us our water We had to wait to get any chips or for our because they ran out of the they use under the chips Food was good were even better For being a large place you would think they know how to be more organized and operate a more professional smoother experience for theirTwo are for the view quite gorgeous even when it s super sunny and blazing hot The food was pretty bad definitely edible but not very at all and we had much much better for much This food left a lot to be desired and the service t greatPerfect anything powder Don t expect convenience or quality Of course Sunset they cannot controlThe best thing about this place is the view the service is horrible the server took forever to just get to the table let alone to get or anything else you might need they need to hire enough to give the service people deserve especially since this place so much volumeThe view is the only reason to come here The are crazy long the customer service is atrocious and the food is very average at best and way It s great to visit one time but once you have you don t need to come backFood is over priced great view though if you have a good eye sight if you dont i wouldnt coming here then unless you like over crowded cold over priced foodI never thought Hell s parking lot could fill up Good chips and but a serious beating of an experience There are way too many good to endure this kind of service and hassle small expensive and over priced foodThe are only for the location Beautiful place to visit However the food is mediocre I t go here for lunch dinnerI like the oasis for the dancing in the music but it s become a drag lately when under the new management they re these meet up to reserve all the tables for their that t even there yet meanwhile are scrambling for tables it really inconvenientGreat view atrocious food I went here for the first and last time during a work event I t know any better so I ordered food because this place was billed as a restaurant I thought it was odd that of my all went with the hamburger but soon after I got my meal I quickly the error of my ways I ordered the Chile which is a fairly common dish in these a stuffed chile usually with meat and cheese lightly fried These are typically pretty delicious no matter where you get it Not here What I got was this lifeless tasteless non fried chile with some sort of sweet meat in it It was horrible To make worse it was on top of a corn husk that absolutely no purpose other than to annoy the customer since you can t cut anything until it s removed and My experience t all bad i t pay for the meal since it was a work outing The chips and are pretty good Water was delicious It s truly a shame the food t better because it s a beautiful restaurant and view This place would be an absolute gold mine if they d hire a good chef and serve someWaitress made us feel like we were wasting her time talking Me Can you tell me about your soup What s the bowl look like She my next statement and it s a bowl Bigger than a cup Take another minute to look at the menu Then she ran off and t come back for or more We WERE ready to order just trying to get advice on the meal Then when I about getting a half order of she cut me off and said they don t do that Then she t know what a chicken was when I tried to order one a la carte to go with a cup of soup What goes in that So I know how to ring it up like a side of chicken Really t we in I gave up and ordered the dang bowl Food was fine service was snottyIt s one of those you go to to say you went there Come here for the view not for the food Even then there are lots of other in where you can get a view of the sunset It might not be as good of a view as you can get here but you don t have to drive out far wait forever for a table and eat terrible food I think paying for mediocre ground beef is outrageous I can get excellent beef at Hula Hut for the same price The only other thing you might be by here is the size of the restaurant I swear it s bigger than my high school and upon upon All that being said I would recommend coming here only once just to watch the sun set over the lake It would be pointless to come here any other time besides sunset Believe me I went once for lunch and sitting by the lake t worth it because it was hot and there are lots of other in that offer lakeside seatingBrought here from State We were sat outside for a nice view Until all of the bees My wife was stung on her leg The staff did offer a wipe for her sting and made sure she was They that they have a bee problem So we inside The food was just with stale chips No to go backThis is not the Oasis I remember Even after the fire and this was a cool location with great food and energetic service The view is still there but they re now charging for the view via their BEWARE The menu and not for the better Recently took some there and for three and nine we That s OUTRAGEOUS The food was passable in quality but the were small Additional charge for cheese on a that was already priced at really Service t great either My recommendation Go for the view have a drink or two and leaveTook my brother and his fiance who were visiting from out of town t been to the Oasis for several and a bit disappointed to see how much it Of course the view is gorgeous but the food have become astronomical and the quality is poor Our food was cold by the time it got to our table and my drink was so watered down I could barely taste the alcohol In all we had a good time but don t go to eat Check out the view have a beer and call it a nightI was going to physical therapy and we were going to One of them told me about a really nice restaurant that I had to visit while traveling there We this restaurant up on YELP of course The and were pretty good however my experience was not that great Driving up to the restaurant was so exciting because it was a beautiful scene They have ample parking It like a city mall but all up and nice We at about p m on The hostess us upstairs to where we would be seated We sat indoors because it was too hot and humid to sit outside however they do have and water from the We received chips and pretty fast A very nice by the name of us It took forever for anyone to come to our table and serve us We ordered the because it look fabulous on YELP IT was really good So bad thing here was when they finally brought the out we had eaten the chips and more chips with the There were some that by but they never our way They only on who they were tending too We and I got up out of my seat and went to look for someone I found the hostess that sat us and I told her how my frozen drink came out watery we more chips and now the was cold She found the waiter and he came over and took the item back They prepared another drink for me and this time it WAS frozen I m happy now but the t come out We did finally order our food and that took forever My daughter t like the pull pork She said the bread tasted weird The server got lost again UGH We had to find someone else to ask to replace the item They took it back and was very cordial about it My with the pretzel bun was really good I would definitely order again but I won t be going back to this restaurant any time soon They customer service BIG TIME It was a slow day so I m unsure as to why the service was so horrible Oasis you have a good restaurant and you really need to fix this problem because I know you get much and I m unsure how you handle this if we were this way Oh yeah it s very My was because I for a pretzel bun instead of the regular bun so they up me The server said they could substitute the bun but he t say there would be an up charge The is very nice The view is phenomenal If you want to experience the atmosphere than this is a perfect tourist attraction Our suggestion is to order a few eat chips and take at sunset It s sad that I had to rant but this is the truth I hope have a better experience than we didFirst if you are allergic to bees beware At lunch on a sunny day they are actively on your and food I my Pepper so that I could eat my chicken salad Crazy that I had to wait for a knife which is necessary for such large of sliced chicken breast Ask for citrus vinaigrette unless you love honey mustard One of the bees the honey mustard so much that he in it I totally agree with from so I repeat her Overall this place was a huge disappointment They did have a nice view but it s not worth the drive nor the money just to get a look at some water and in the horizon I had fast food that tasted better and had more flavoring Never againOn my way to find the lake I see saying The Oasis so I stopped to explore investigate It was a mid s day today in so a sunset apropos Upon arrival I was by semi smiling who me a table if I one after I went out on deck to take a peek Of course I went back to ask for a table The view was mighty fine Not THE best I ever seen at sunset but great nonetheless I ordered from the invisible dessert menu key lime pie Acceptable I be back to taste the quick lunch get a better view w out all of the many in my way blocking theIncredibly and food very sloppy and slow but friendly service but an interesting experience I m glad I went once the view was pleasant and it was fun to see everyone get excited about the sunset Our table had a giant column blocking the actual sunset view I won t be back but I m glad I went onceSimple you come for the view and not food or drink I ordered a vodka cranberry and it tasted like a margarita Also the food tasted generic nothing too great To me this is a one time placeThe service is great The view is amazing but the food was we were disappointed and t even attempt to finishThe food is not that interesting but the view is awesome We were there while the sun set so it was beautifulWhile the view at the Oasis is great the service wait time and the food is beyond mediocre It forever to get anything water or chips and forget it if anything is wrong with your food You wait forever You also can t rely on anyone other than your waiter to bring you anything other than a water refill or a napkin Won t happen I know it a lot to run a restaurant this size but they do it poorlyThe was decent at best The tasted like frozen bagged from mart The view and Atmosphere were amazing though Visiting is worth it just for that Dont go great food and you wont be disappointed The live was and the hot They were awesome them The service in the bar music area was awful We eventually had to just go up to the bar to payI got the Redfish Which if anyone anything about fish that redfish is probably the most delectable fish in the ocean is easy to season and even easier to cook They sear it with almost no seasoning whatsoever and give you a side of flavorless oil to dip it in As someone raised in and is definitely qualified to review this place is in the middle of and nowhere close to the sea but anyone with a culinary brain would have the sense to season redfish The sides it came with however were delectable The and rice were awesome but the most important part of the dish the protein was completely flavorless I for this meal Don t waste your time with it honestly The service I have no with The alcohol was as well I m glad with the fact that if you spend for a top shelf margarita that they give you a decent enough glass Definitely a tourist trapEveryone else said it Perhaps the buzz of people there are there only for the view not so much for the food not to mention too Sunset is gorgeous and romantic but that s pretty much all there is about that placeThis place is like The granada ca of BEAUTIFUL from a hilltop that entice you in But it all there Maybe I m spoiled by great food in LA but this stuff is Super salty chicken Mediocre tortilla Mild Super salty fire For per entree and really weak I d rather spend my money elsewhere I m glad I came here once for the experience but there is WAY better food in I d still rate this higher than because at least t covered with a layer of smog like the San Valley isThe view and atmosphere is absolutely amazing But I had better at Bell If they ever their menu maybe go because food is not their talent I would go backThe view Amazing I bet that s what they re advertising The food I think they get it from Bell If you appreciate quality food don t be by the sunsetYou come for the view not the food I would just stick to and hereMy husband and I went here for the first time the other week t end up going there for sunset we went in the middle of the day which was a BAD idea It was so unbearably hot and the hostess sat us in a section where there were no Really That pretty much ruined it for me The view is nice but the food was over priced and not so goodFood is not good and but the view of the sunset is fabulous They do have ice creamThe are good but you can see similar by just driving up here Came here on a and everything was closed there was nothing really to do Not worth the longer drive out in my opinionStunning location but mediocre food Grab a drink or two and head to s if you want to have real Probably a good hangout place Not for Limited and bland food Make sure you check your food if you order vegetarian We ordered couple of with no meat but the chef added it anywaysGreat View Great Over priced made with cheap liquor Bad News Lousy food I can only recommend the Everything else is bad I eat before I go there I take my out of town visitor here for the view and avoid the food and I thought that after the fire and the old kitchen burned down that they would improve not the caseThe view from this place is absolutely gorgeous Seeing the sunset fall on the lake is one of the I seen in Unfortunately that s pretty much the only good thing this place going for it The food is awful AWFUL I am the type of person who will usually happily eat anything but I have never eaten anything here that was anything better than bad The menu is uninspired the section is a nightmare unless you like they re on almost every plate without an a la carte option for other Boring boring To make worse everything is way An hamburger That bun had better be speckled with sesame made of gold the are terrible too So if you are ever unfortunate enough to visit The Oasis do yourself a favor and only order chips and a drink enjoy the view for a few and get the heck out Escape to a better restaurant I just wish someone who actually how to prepare food would buy this beautiful building and start overYesterday was Valentine s day and we made here for the sweetheart dinner For almost we were cold food and most of it did not even taste good The sunset however was priceless and is the only thing that saved this experienceThe only good thing about the Oasis is the view Beautiful view of sunset over Lake Travis Beyond that not much good to say I have been to Oasis several times food always been very average and the service below average Best thing you can do here is have a cocktail enjoy the view and go somewhere else to eatFood is terrible I d give the food star MAYBE The on the other hand LOVE those Especially in the summer when all the are up Don t miss the sunset There is a lot of traffic during rush hour to get here but it is worth it to me for that sunsetThe food is tasteless food not the best Our server was nice but had to many table to wait on that he forgot about us Margarita was nasty overall you just come here for the view of the lake other than not the best place to come Maybe just for drink but beer no take my word for itThe food was not good and unsupervised spit on us from a balcony above Our lone highlight was our great waiterMy friend brought me here for the first time yesterday at I everything about the place until I met our waiter He was rude surly slow and forgot of our order We had to get another waiter to help us when We that several around us were not with him either He almost ruined my experienceI honestly believe that if it t for the view the Oasis t be in business This is my second time coming here It s almost customary to bring out of state It s a cool looking restaurant with a lot of fun and The view of Lake Travis is stellar It really is beautiful Especially at dusk But that s about it The staff and the food is The first time we went was a horrible experience The second time was better but still very Both times we went were during the week after mealtime Not busy at all Yet the and wait staff are slow as molasses Must be on island time The food is Not completely horrible but not a place I m likely to say I m craving the Oasis Some of the that are in the range definitely t worth it Even my t anything to be excited over for additional is pointless because they have short term memory loss We for ranch for Hey we like ranch with our We a couple times I also for some spread for my because the bun was dry A runner came by with an extra cup for my year old so I again if we could get some ranch and she said You will have to ask your server because that s not something I do I was very caught off guard by that Even if you don t do that or it s not in your job description if she had good customer service she would have said something like absolutely no problem left and told our server Basically it felt like hey not my job Needless to say by the time we were done with our meal the ranch came But we sent it back because we obviously t need it We thought that our first visit might have been a fluke but no that s just how they operate Maybe they feel like they can be below average because people will still come for the view I was always taught to strive to be great but I guess management that life lesson as child They got two because of the viewTwo only for the location Perfect lake Good server but equally bad food I ordered chicken spicy sandwich Frozen chicken that tasted so hard when i tried to chew it It had that frozen crunch texture to it For this perfectly restaurant with million dollar it is a very below average food they are offering They should call who can come overhaul the restaurant I will come here for again and a beer But no food for me at this restaurantThe view is amazing were good food was expensive for the quality service was horrible I would come back for and sunset maybe not overly Spilt meat was dry some were over seasoned some had no seasoning was good so was and but nothing to brag about had they didnt look good they didnt seem overly happy either You pay to look at the lake and sunset over it ill find a friend with a boatThe are still great but the service is dismal I have been regularly coming for the last ten and each time the service is worse and worse The most recent visit was just too much We had to ask three times for water Every request more took a crazy amount of time To add insult to the comedy we were out of chips before they brought the refill but of course no more chips They seem to specialize in which may be the problem Oasis you are my favorite place to come when I am here I am faithful but man how you have the ballNo surprise here but I state the obvious You re paying for the view and not much else And that view is quite awesome they that land at the right time As for the food WAY When I for a side of with my chips I t know i d be getting at appetizer add on I don t think anything on the menu no matter how small is under Two two a and two Anyway that s enough about that Our waitress was obviously in a bad mood from the get go we were the very first people there at AM on a weekday She was short with us and t smile that s all fine have to keep myself I m there for the view Did I mention the view is wonderfulstar view star food Last time we went I stopped by and got a dollar before we met Order chips and and enjoy the view I wish I was brave enough to find a menu item to prove me wrong But if you re like everyone else you keep finding to go backLast I wrote a review that said So order a Shiner eat some chips with a side of and go somewhere else for dinner I just that and now say the soothsayer in Beware of chicken stuffed with Tomatillo sauce I got a serious case of food poisoning which put me out of for days In you can t beat The Oasis for best view And you expect to pay more for the food precisely because of that Millions have been spent to create a safe if somewhat atmosphere on the But I never again ignore my original adviceBest view of Lake Travis Service was average Food was garbage and for how bad it was were dumbYou d think with all of the money flowing in this place to hold people they would have something just a little better to offer As in other the only reason to come here is the view but here s an idea that will save you time and a whole lot of money pack your own picnic and have it on some land next door to The Oasis The menu were some of the most boring I ever seen some some some there was nothing interesting I went with the Ranchero a grilled chicken breast smothered in ranchero sauce on a bed of rice and on the side When the are the best part of the meal you know you re in trouble The chicken had clearly been frozen probably for several days and the ranchero sauce t have been anything more than some ketchup with some chopped All this for The three with us who had also said they were weak It s a shame that a place in such a good location can t serve up something better Service t the best in the world but it was pretty good considering the crowd The music on the third floor was way too loud and I m not an old geezer either We were from the stage and you could still barely talk to the person next to you Want to check out The Oasis Come by have a few check out the take some and take offSo to summarize every other review A The view is great B The are expensive C The food is lousy D The service is E The interior is gaudy You re going to go anyway so what does it matterIf you are in from out of town the view and atmosphere outside is amazing but the food and service leave much to be desired With the amazing food in I don t think it s worth your timeThis place flat out The food is mediocre or usually worse Without the great view of Lake Travis this place would not have The staff try to do good job but they re usually the that end up being for the food If this place had even good food it would be fine for repeat but twice was enough for us will not beWe were seated quickly however our server t want to do the work we for an umbrella or different table because the sun was us directly and she just kept saying she had to find one t seem very enthusiastic and t greet us politely was just very disappointing because it was my first time there a young man who t even our server got us an umbrella right away we t even ask him for it he just took the initiative The young lady working the host counter was also rude to us when we if we could move tables because the sun was too strong Great and food but experience was poor because of our server who also checked on us maybe twice after she saw that us outThe building is really cool especially the abandoned and that are everywhere It like a modern ruin or like we are seeing just the start of this place falling into abandonment I thought that it was as neat to see the abandoned stuff as it was to see the view maybe more so me want to buy the place and actually put in a good restaurant here As for the oasis itself we kept our simple based on the we read Even this too much to handle Although the waiter who took our was very smooth the food was by some stoned looking hillbilly They definitely me on the which were nasty anyway and there was no ketchup I had to walk up and ask for some then I finally got so hungry I ate half my without it So We got back at the waiter though Ordered some and them and sat in the sun for another That was nice Straight IN SUMMARY Some are so outwardly beautiful that they can get away with acting like horrible people and still find a million men who are happy to beThis place is awful I mean really bad The only thing nice is the view and that s the only reason I gave it a star But everything else was so bad I don t know how they can get away with it The food tasted as if it was and up The were watered down They t even have good Tequila Seriously Go for the view But don t order any foodThe view of the sunset is great and the frozen hit the spot on hot summer but the food is really just bad and it s crowded Sunset are great for out of town but please go somewhere else to eat or if you want a romantic setting As the menu the restaurant can seat about two thousand people and they do try Tables are put so close together the wait staff a hard time fitting the and The place is crawling with so if you have a table close to the railing it s likely that you have lots of around you and your table close to sunset I t make it a dinner destination but a good spot to grab a drink and enjoy the sunset with a group They don t take official but you can call ahead with the time you arrive and be to the top of the when the full party which can cut down the waitDid I mention This place is with lackluster food service menu The only this place two are the and gorgeous view Other than that I can spend elsewhere and get A LOT more than a s meal chilled shrimp and soggy of mango and a margarita OH my favorite part I for a ramekin of pineapple for my as she t like the under ripe and nasty melon they her and they tried to charge me Yes you read that correctly for a ramekin of pineapple Ugh this place is so it s actually insulting Save your money go elsewhereAwful food so so service but GREAT view Come for a drink but don t waste a cent on the foodHad not been here in several It remains what it is An amazing view with terrible food and service I know a lot people are blown away I am notWe drove to check it out because we had about the Sad to say that Lake Travis is only about full and it really it which was disappointing The restaurant up to it s reputation as being one of the in which turned out not to be a good thing when it comes to food or service because personal attention to quality is really missing They spread the wait staff out between to many tables so you very rarely see your waiter waitress The food is not bad but it is definitely mass produced Go here for the view when we had a good year for rain and the lake is full but not for good service or foodWhen we got there at on there was no one hardly at the restaurant I specifically the hostess to give me and my who are our the BEST POSSIBLE She us at what I like the call the armpit of the restaurant behind a large amount of that are completely blocking our view of everything Literally all we could see was white red and green I politely if we could be to a table with a better view seeing that the place was empty it t think it was too much to ask The staff went from being somewhat nice and professional to be completely rude and unprofessional in that very instance It was as though they sent out a message to the entire staff to let them know to be rude to us from that point on Our waitress came out and literally what s wrong with this view You want a better view then this My response was simple I would like to see something other than like the water and the actual view With extreme attitude she the and chips and off yelling back some people are so picky We were to an amazing table with a beautiful view We ended up an incredible waitress who was so sweet and fun We had a blast and the heck out of the rest of our experience I am glad I tables for two the view was terrible and the waitress s attitude was worse then any I have ever experienced Thank goodness I to move and we got a great view with the perfect waitress She is the only reason I can give this place more than a star she saved the day for sure Thank you for being amazing You get for sure Your management team needs to learn a lesson about professionalism and customer service from you Come on Oasis you have their perfect location to provide an amazing all around experience You can do better than this Get it togetherI have never been with the food here but the service my group and I received today was absolutely terrible The young man who took down our reservation was extremely rude to us it was shocking how rude he was The staff mostly did not acknowledge us I understand it was an extremely busy time when we went but they should have at least said something along the of Thank you for your patience I be with you as soon as possible or something similar to that The only reason this place is doing as well is because of the gorgeous I would not recommend this place to anyone for their food or their service the only reason to come is to look at the viewOne star for the really great view and the parking Minus one for so so food minus another for higher than should be and minus s third for serving in cheap plastic such potential but they do have a great view and do enjoy itJust like most of the the view great the food terrible If they t charge gourmet for fast food quality at best it t be nearly as bad had better food out of a microwave In fact that s exactly what the like I got the surf n turf which apparently in shrimp and an unappetizing cut of beef not lobster and fillet like I always had However the view is terrific but be sure to request either a deck or window table as the view t as great from the inner tables Bottom line Eat an early dinner before you go get a table near the enjoy a few while the sun and maybe order a little dessert t try that but I don t think you can really screw up dessertSo everyone s review on here was about the same GREAT view ball park quality food and sloppy service all are close but not dead on THE VIEW its pretty but you can enjoy the view by simply driving up the hill and getting out just park in their lot then walk around and enjoy the You don t have to pay a plate just to see the view Our server was friendly and and had no with getting our order correct Poor are generally going to happen at all and they dont last long THE FOOD I had the Grilled Shrimp which were tasty but not for shrimp tasty And the pretty limp and color of over boiling so they definitely were not only Thats who is coming for anyway right If you are on taking a date here think again she will not be by the food probably will like the view and the but in the end will still think your a jack ass if she the bill and if she doesnt your still a jackass My advice take a trip only if your already near by and don t plan on eating just grab a beer or two and enjoyGreat of Lake Really mediocre The Sol margarita at was especially weakWorst food best view in Adequate Go here to enjoy the view and a cocktailI have to be honest If you are coming here you re coming for the experience not for the food If you have out of town a nice banquet dinner or a romantic date you have to come here The trick is to come before sunset order your food and or watch the absolutely gorgeous sunset as it down on the beautiful blue water while you eat and then see the twinkling in the dark All you really need to understand from my review is that the food t good but the will surpass your So what you re coming for is the view but the food is your ticket to see itSave your money time and the Oasis a great view but the food you ever consume The only thing that can save you if you come here is a stiff drink and a prayer that you re seated near enough a window or outside to view the sceneryI hate The Oasis For so many The staff is poop The hostess hate their sorry it s hot Sorry it s busy However this is why you have a job Smile The and have actually been pretty good So this review went from star to now The food Mediocre at best At best No flavor The You are paying for the f so much for it A is not worth especially when I could put some Kraft cheese in a tortilla and make the exact same thing Again paying for the view However location Amazing Tourist trap I bring family from out of town EVERY single time because did I mention the You re lucky you got that golden nugget Oasis because otherwise I d never be back and based on the either would of the otherThe place crowded and touristy I wonder why after all the of people saying the view is great but the food is terrible that they do not hire some decent I think it become cliche to say this if you are from to the point of if they did people will still think this It is like an actor who is to certain because of one he or she at one point That said I do not think it is that terrible not good but not terrible for bar food Will go there is there is a decent band which is rare as wellThe view is beautiful but the food is bland and the service forever Sat over an hour before we got our everyone s food at different times and the Sat for an hour and a half waiting for our check The novelty of the view quickly wore off after waiting for so longSuperb specially on when you don t have to fight a thousand people to watch the sun set The food is average but face it you don t eat here for the foodThis is some of the worst food I ever eaten Very bland and very uninspiring like it came straight from the freezer This is very clearly a drinking establishment with a nice view I would go elsewhere if you are looking for a legitimate mealThis t a traditional review as I never even got to eat the food I was here for a private party the sunset It really is a great view and the were nice and not But to make a very long story short we had a member of our group that was allergic to tree The restaurant was notified ahead of time and the waiter confirmed there were NO in the dish later we had the pen out and the There are pine in their stuffed chicken Unless you want a fun ride in the ambulance I would steer clear of The Oasis if you have any sort of food allergy A manager did come over quickly to assess the situation where he never for the situation just took her information and tried to argue with me when I for a copy of their incident report It could have been handled with a lot more tact and overall customer service Instead come for the pretty sunset have a drink and leaveBasically they bought this land built a giant thing on it and thought we could maybe sell food I guess whatever and now they charge too much for it It s still a cool experience with awesome but don t expect any semblance of good foodTourist trap food nothing special Good if you get the right table Our waiter was kind of weird alsoThe view is one of the best in our service was good kitchen was slow but server was good as well and the chips were great Now thats it The food was disgusting I had the they tasted like the chef took dill tartar sauce and filled two with chip dip I them up and they the same I actually ask my waiter what they where supposed to be filled with He said crab and shrimp As I picked through the I found no fish no crab no cheese nothing just dill tartar sauce chip dip I still don t understand how one a dish filled with a fish but that s another story and since it s did not have any in it anyway and for a dollar dish ridiculous I want say the view was great right before a thunderstorm hit seriously go drink ring the bell enjoy the view and stay away from the over priced disgusting foodThe great view is ruined by the fact that you re on a deck with other people eating sub par and tasteless I think there are better ways to experience the lakeGreat Every thing else is pretty weak But you go there for and not foodObviously the view is amazing That s why we went there But the food is so mediocre it s unreal This was the first time I been here and I really GOOD food I ordered the redfish Something I assumed nobody could f up It was awful No flavor There was literally no seasoning on the fish They just it on the grill and it with a side of butter no If I m paying for redfish it better be the bomb I can cook it better myself and I m no chef Next time I come to I skip the extended drive and sacrifice the view for somewhere that can actually serve a delicious mealBeautiful location and food was good but the service and of the staff we saw were terribleI was in the airport one day heading back to and a know it all executive type a first time visitor about where to go in He t doing too well and was obviously trying to impress her with his knowledge naming off a slew of typical touristy without taking note of what she might be into One suggestion was for The Oasis I had to interject Go fed I said and I t have meant it more sincerely The Oasis a fabulous view This is absolutely true the view is gorgeous as the sun is setting It s also true that the food is nasty and I used to joke with my roommate who s palate and cuisine importantly from mine that she might enjoy sticking some type of fish into a smelly sock it marinate for a few days then it up for a tasty dinner The Oasis brought back the memory of her cooking in full force I was always too full to try her food and it s a good idea if you re too full for the Oasis The are not that bad and if you head out on a night they have a band until sundown they did last summer anyway You can dance your hunger away except you re not hungry because you read this review and ate something anything else before goingFood is average or below with above average price The view at sunset is nice its a shame that the owner t care about the food quality I guess he is making money in spite of the poor foodThe World of patio There is seriously SO MUCH going on at this place visually that is Everything else not so much going on When we were seated at our table and I out over Lake Travis on a evening sunset I felt a brief moment of paradise The view is definitely worth the trip but I might suggest just a few here before heading elsewhere for dinner The had a heavy hand in the sweet sour and too light of a hand in the booze You know when you had two and have no feeling whatsoever it s time to switch to beer before you drink for Out of the stuffed and that were had among my table it was all and tasted like something I could get from a food booth at World Simply unremarkable and quite frankly With that million dollar view this restaurant could easily be on a night if only the food was better I was there on a and it t For shameTwo for the view only The food is tragic and watered down andThe oasis is really somewhere I try to avoid but they do have some fun upstairs I m pretty sure everyone that they have a super long wait way and food and terrible service I refuse to eat there because I have never in had something good and the are out of control for what you get My friend ordered the shrimp and it was so not worth it The wait staff is so busy they sprint past your table and maybe give you to order if you miss your window you won t see them again for It s chaotic uncomfortable cheap tables and a maze to get around and loud as hell Yes the are great but honestly go for a few maybe one drink and then bounce I d never suggest to go there but my gal pal to see and Suede play there along with the rest of the dang townBeautiful view slow service ugh another slow service while eating out at we had been sitting there for approximately and kept looking around to look for someone but no to help us out Food is alright not the best i have had but not the worst one tho needs more seasoning food is but I understand whyDear Oasis owner Beau My how change in such a short of a time When I wrote my review The Oasis was such a splendid place So very unique So very So very And in less than a year you it Now so very touristy To the point to where I feel to vent See Beau the food were never very good But it t just the view that made me excuse it it was this whole feel of community that the restaurant had with the open main deck the outdoor stage the But you apparently never understood why you were so successful Otherwise you would never close the main deck to put in let me get this straight Retail And you build these admittedly beautiful but inside yes not outside but inside that are open to the outdoors and think we re going to all get the same Now it just like a representation of what it was Instead of the setting and the landscape speak for itself everything is stone and fake hit you over the head This is some misguided you had Beau It s as if you re wanting to sink to the worst shallow self indulgent of the Please dumb Please come to this place where everything is as fake and shallow as the place you fled Before I felt to show people this unique place that they t find anywhere else Now I feel like I should be them through the gift shop to buy on the way out Beau your food Your tequila Your wait staff is friendly but slow And now the one thing you had going for you your atmosphere like For all the good you have done in the past living in the midst of apparently done you a disservice and therefore a huge disservice I think the fire took more than some of your in the hill it apparently took your soul But I don t have to support that And I shall not be backFIVE star view star food and service As s say You don t go the Oasis for the food This is a bar up high on a hill Lake Travis great forYou should absolutely come here for the amazing view of the sunset but that is it Service is extremely slow and inattentive and the food is mediocre to terrible are super basic Still worth the drive for the view thoughFirst time going and I can say with confidence that I will not be back Went for my mother s birthday because she had gone several back and to go to celebrate her If I was grading the view Food was and I could probably get better at Cabana The rice was good but that was about it The waiter was a jerk argumentative with Wow As someone who s worked in customer service for This guy was a grade A douche I m sure he was a trainer but he needs some training himself Purple shirt beard and probably late s early s He was working upstairs tonight on Drove from SA just to eat there and if anyone ever this place to go to again in the future No thanksWe at and were told we would have a so we went upstairs for a few Plenty of seating easy access to the beer wine bar After waiting for we decided to check in on our reservation Hostess informed us that we could go in and get seated As we were seated we another couple who had been behind us in the reservation line was already seated and enjoying Once seated we ordered and the food took over an hour cold AND twice Yep A entire second set of food was to our table which we of course sent back Lots of crazy going on seemingly without much management oversight Once we eating we were by a creepy older woman who to take our picture for a fee Gave us the If you are going strictly for the view it was beautiful Everything else needs a major overhaul I d fire management and start over Definitely needs more organization and communicationLousy food iced tea and rushed service with a view I ordered a to play it safe and it was to the point of being dangerous to consume I love a medium rare but it t be cold and raw inside Get a good location and you don t have to worry about anything else I guessThe view is really nice When I to sit outside the waitress by saying there was nothing to look at just a pond We sat outside eventually had some yummy Those were good but the food was so basic The place lots of potential because of location but the food and is expensiveI m new to So as my first day as a local I decide to try out the oasis bad idea The woman who me obviously her job The food was And the chips tasted just like the food was The of the lake on the wasOne star for the view one star for the to sunset No star for the service which barely and this is after going there times giving them the benefit of the doubt of an off day and no star for the food again The first time I went with family and second and third time with my When the food is so and the service is unbelievably bad this restaurant is just a good location that could be used by better managementThe view is the best part of the restaurant The food is just I would return but I d only go for and to watch the sunsetGreat view but that s about it Wonder what will happen once lake is all dried out You can save a lot of money by not or food It big timeI m an native and by my restaurant not super picky about food and service this place is not up to par even by Our server came by once every if even which is a bit ridiculous Come for and the fantastic view ask for your check min before you plan to leave and go to the across the highway for dinnerThe ONLY reason to come to this place is for the fabulous view I love looking down at all the toward the lake No matter how mediocre the food and service are I would return just to sit out and stare over the view and only during off on a weekday The service leaves little to be desired We sat down on a hot spring day and our table t have an umbrella blocking the afternoon sun I our server if she could grab one and stick it in the umbrella stand Well she at me like she wished she could stuff it where the sun don t shine and a couple of tables away to grab one of the folded up leaning against the wall I somewhat for her to go out of her way This to have caught her attention and she less rude as our stay went on especially when I her by name on her name tag I ordered a chicken salad which was fairly decent but what the heck is the random triangle of orange goo with it Reminiscent of ambrosia but I don t think it into any foodGreat view and efficient service Boring food and their perfect margarita was a perfect disappointmentThe view is beautiful but my meal t as The salmon flavor Customer service was excellentNo one can deny the view but the food is mediocre at best And that s quite a stretch I wish the would take pride in their restaurant location and actually provide good food It d be incredible to have a good meal and look at our pathetic lake right Not some cardboard enchilada and useless salad I can t complain about the service or howeverWe been here a couple of times Sure the view is wonderful especially at sunset but the food is basically crap and worse it s for crap it s for decent fare They could actually care about good food and be one of the best to go If I ever go there again it will be for alcohol and a sunsetThe VIEW of this place truly is magnificent Absolutely indescribable It s unfortunate that the restaurant t reflect the excellence of this place but you can get by FOOD I thoroughly through the and sought out the most decent plate I could find The with sweet potato to get the best review Nearly the whole table got the I was it to be pretty rough but surprisingly it t bad It t anything memorable nothing I would go back for but it t awful The food was the was a bean with other and mix The bun was nice and flavorful at the table got the house salad with chicken They said it was nothing special they got it because it was hard to mess up The chicken was interesting but not something to throw out Otherwise the chips and were pretty I the spice to the and it was awesome If you Go waste money on not the food SERVICE Definitely was not a fan of the service We had a waitress that was unattentive snippy and had a poor attitude We were lucky to get our filled up more than once she rolled her if we for something and she had an attitude with every response Poor poor service but they know people will come because the view is unreal ATMOSPHERE This place is beautiful Absolutely beautiful The view you feel like you re looking out at the ocean in It is magnificence phenomenal Two people got engaged in the we were there Here s the bad part This place is dirty The outdoor seating is crowded and obviously sweltering Don t even go into the unless you re unphased by that haven t been in a solid year The view is what this place running still It s truly unfortunate they really need to get a different system or the view for crum service foodSo Sad I live min from the Oasis but have not to get enough to tackle the mammoth parking garage and inevitable to get to the so so food and view Oh wait a minute What view There t been a lake here since OThank goodness for the view because the food t keep this restaurantI think to visit one time is It s a restaurant with many to seat inside or outside but we to wait almost to seat Many people there everywhere Menu is poor and food is not good Actually nothing special Staff is not friendly I m giving just because setting and landscape is amazing This is the only thing that made our visit worth it They also have a cute store and we bought some there I can t understand why a place like that is not good What a pity because if service was good I could be back to drink a beer seeing the landscape and the lake thereFirst visit While visiting in we decided to visit this place It was off the beaten path and quite a drive Parking was a bit Yet we made it of the little are closed Closed as in closed There was a long line to the hostess desk We were told it would be a hour wait My friend spoke with the manager and our wait was less than min We sat outside by a little dirt area with a small stage Wish their was live music there Service was No wow factor Waiter seem to just how hot it was the whole time The to be down the floor was dirty were It was disgusting were just in major need of a cleaning Garbage was over flowing to be swept I can see the inside of the kitchen while walking into our eating area and the floor was filthy I mean come on people if the health department walk through you so would be closed down then and there It was hazardous not just for their guest But as well We only ordered dessert because my said don t waste you money on the food We took her advice to par and t order a meal were about average We ordered the cheesecake chocolate and the ice cream It was not bad How can you mess up made It was not bad Taste as good as cheese cake I had a plastic cup of ice water which the waiter brought out for like people He told use to stay hydrated because it was hot outside Well at It s not so hot Thank for your thoughtfulness They had mist fan and more to cook down the deck area Along with like Which the waiter took down min before the sunset The thrown in the back like they were a ball that would land softly That really me no pride in company property One thing I t like was the sun so strong on the lake water You can get a sun tan on your face I kept my back facing the lake This lake water is very low I think it s more like filled I felt bad as I at the of the lake more than away from the water The drought affected this lake as well If you are a sunset lover Visit this place order something to drink stay and watch the sunset Be prepared to wait for Which I t understand because there were of seating that were empty star for not so bad dessert star for sunset star for service star for star for cleanlinessWe Oasis in March The lake is beautiful but I was not happy with our service We went upstairs to listen to music and it was so crowded We found a spot but had to wipe down our own table We decided to just chips and since the wait was long We our bill with a credit card and left I got a bank alert that my card however was Luckily I kept the receipt They did reimburse our account a week later but it took me the receipt making about phone If you do go for the I would go at lunch when it is not as crowded and I would pay with cash Keep your receipt if you do pay with a cardWent to The Oasis for the first time tonight with family We were there for and to see the sunset I have to say I was really disgusted by the They ran out of toilet paper so people were to use the paper to dry your A staff member did come in and I her if they had staff to clean and pickup in the bathroom She said eh not really and she t do anything about it My feeling is if you work there she could have done something about itstar sunset and view star food Shockingly small selection of fare at outrageously high think San level but with Bell taste if you are lucky This is a great place to take out of especially those who don t live somewhere with great or who have never been to the hill country They won t know that the food and they will absolutely adore you for the scenic drive out there and the heart stopping view and sunset The building itself is vastly after being rebuilt after the fire although the collection of become more of an obsession now Seriously how many people in the world can there be who are looking to purchase a giant bronze statue of doing see no evil speak no evil hear no evil I d guess that it is less than the number of on my body Food selection is piss poor at best and will leave you wishing you just had a few Actually the with and meat was pretty good but is pretty much impossible to mess up I tried the shrimp last night shrimp stuffed with a slice I d bet one of my previously that they were Cisco frozen style and they were still totally and tough as leather The bed of rice tasted like it was in the ocean How much salt can someone put in a serving of rice were fair are mostly frozen but you can request on the which clearly are made with a mix rather than fresh lime and hand shaking as they should be at these Bottled are good though Service was but slow I guess I can t blame them with the number of people and of decking A light bulb just went on in my head my solution to the Oasis besides don t go Visit with out of town order a and chips for dinner and drink beer only Perfect You can pick up some street after you take them downtownI thoroughly enjoy the Oasis on Lake Travis and have been coming here for Even before they expanded into what it is today The food is I definitely recommend the or The are good too Service is usually always very good until this last time we went about two ago We drove up from specifically to enjoy an afternoon at the Oasis We were sat quickly and had a great view but our waitress was a huge miss It took her to come to us was not very friendly not rude but t seem to want to be there and spoke very quietly so we could barely hear her We ordered the specialty that you can take the hurricane glass home Our waitress apparently did not know this was a thing because she never to clean the glasses out so we could take them She confused when that was For the first time I chose to forgo my usual chicken dish and try the They were awful The whole plate was cold the chicken had no flavor and it was just bad I set the plate off to the side of me after moving the food around a bit and only two three She came by several times and at our table often but never once did she make mention of the food being untouched t even offer a box to take it home Needless to say we were for the Yes I could have said something but it is the job to be attentive and honestly by that point I was not even hungry because it was so bad I imagine this waitress is likely not there and if she is someone please train her better I realize that this restaurant probably had a huge turnaround so I am not going to completely fault them as they t always going to be on it or perfect Just more of a buy beware for those of you who have never been It great and is a fun atmosphere go and enjoy it might become a favorite spot for you tooWell completely less than First off out here visiting family from CA and other than the view i was absolutely not Staff All need an attitude adjustment Food at best Very bland over over priced even with the ridiculous priced sides it tasted blan Time with my Aunt Uncle and was pricelessThe food does not match the scenery Service was less than good we only saw our server times and n ber wa sou chips in the filled or our until we Partner had the and they were so bland Even the rice was tasteless I had the trail and there was nothing special about it at all Won t be back not even for the viewI agree with of when I say that The Oasis an amazing view with very mediocre food Stick to alcohol and chipsAuthentic Cuisine I truly love Oasis No I m This place is all no food Not going to lie I more The are impeccable but the food is a different story The rice is not rice Also the chicken extra dry Neither do I believe this place even under the category of Very very disappointedThe two are for the view The is bland the service is nothing notable and the menu is very small chicken sandwich some sea food and that s essentially it And there is no music if there t a band it s just silent How sad Don t even eat here Get a drink snap some and hit the roadI give this place two because the view alone is amazing at sunset The are fairly good also I on going here to begin with because food was just or not good at all My and I decided to give it a try We were seated after about a minute wait for an outside table on a which t a problem at all I the waitress was she was good because I knew from other food it was just I t believe it when she to me with well you pay for the view here After that my and I just decided to play it safe and get chips and a We went with the chicken which were just I m glad we decided against getting a real meal here I m sad because this place could be amazing but the food just t good at allthis place is all about the view the food still last time i went was fire but a couple of back went for a group lunch when they say whole wheat bun for the they really mean of whole wheat BREAD the fruit that came with it was warm too ugh my friend got some nuclear orange gelatin thing as a side to compliment his chicken wrap and grosser than anything in or i think i wait another few before going backWell calling this place a restaurant is a stretch We tried some of the and the How can you mess up and Well you can if you re the oasis Maybe it s the oasis because the food in front of you is just an illusion The reason I m not giving it a star is that the are great If you re going to go I suggest you order some chips and and some and you have a good time Afterwards you can go have lunch or dinner somewhere elseJust like the majority of on here come for the view skip the food and save yourself the frustration This place the potential to be world class very sadView was spectacular t to have over an hour wait and have food in plastic and plastic Service was NOT good I think they are too busy and to provide the service desired when you go out to eat Would only drive the hour again for the view which u don t need to eat there to viewThe view is good and so are the but that s it The food was bland and the service was terrible and we were there in an off time will not beWe were excited to see what all the fuss was about and watch the sunset The service from the to the left a lot to be desired There was a lot of confusion over where we were supposed to sit and then which person would wait on us It took a long time before we actually even saw a server and even longer to even get some water Sadly I think we got one of the worst tables in the whole place Food was mediocre at best Don t think we be going back Disappointed the whole way aroundMy wife and I went for dinner there on evening We were seated right away for waiter finally one of the hostess to send my waiter to the table another and he up and brought us chips and left another he came back and took our drink and appetizer order he our and appetizer was about later by a kitchen staff person another and again I had to ask the hostess to send the waiter another he up to take our order and our food was by a hostess grilled redfish and shrimp my side did not show up I stopped another hostess and told her to send my waiter he never I stopped another hostess and told her I had not received my sides she said to tell my waiter and I said I would but we t seen him in the last long story short the redfish was like rubber and no taste and the same with the shrimp I never got my sides I another waiter for my check and he said he would get my waiter Another went by and I finally lost it I out the manager and basically told him the same story as I stated above He took the bill and told us he was very sorry and we left Only thing I can say was good was the two and the view and the effort to make it rightThe view was beautiful and but the food Not so much I would definitely only come here for the view because the food was not up to parThis one of the disappointing to eat We re there several ago and it not at all The is that the were good the view was beautiful and the were good The service was awful we sat down and it them around to come by our table She never came by and filled my drink again the time were there The food was bland I could have gotten better food at s Just plain disappointingThis place it off don t go back for food Eat before you go or after Food been sub standard since the place first Seriously it s horrible and over priced Great view over priced everything But good for as a must do onceWhere do i begin I came here for my weekend about this place from but they did not prepare me one bit So i blame them for that So starting with the parking For a great location and a place which i am sure plenty of money the parking is horrible Unless you have a jeep or something that over drive very slow Nothing but broken pavement and gravel Once we got to the the gentleman did tell us there was a wait which i figured we drove all the way up here mind as well stick it out We made it through the outside line and then another host told us outside wait is and inside wait is Took my number and name down and said we would get a once a table becomes available I t understand why so much of a wait there were open tables everywhere Inside and out We the sunset I had to stand outside and just the some footage before it went down The inside of the restaurant is pretty dark and dingy and of as it was a We to the bar and ordered two which were pretty good and strong After an of waiting my phone finally to die and was afraid i would not get the so i went to the front desk and it to the host She if i had another phone which i t and at that point she us to our table By that time it was dark so we t enjoy the lake view and i hoped for Dinner was We got chips and which were good You get your in souvenir which is cool I ordered which were huge but taste was bland Hubby ordered which he Overall I would not here again Maybe the one experience is fine if you really want to check it out besides the view there s not much else If they could cut the wait time and actually seat people in the empty tables it would be great Don t come hungry for sureMy were visiting from so we decided to show them the sunset from the Oasis We told them the food was mediocre but you only go there for the sunset So we up hour before sunset and we an outdoor seat to view the sunset and we were told it d be a min wait We were fine with it and checked out the gift shop min later our buzzer goes off Great We sit early So the girl us to the table and not only is it back by the window it was behind a pole so we ask if we can sit at the clean empty table not far from us Oh that one s already taken but you can be put back on the list So we go in to wait for a new table My husband how long and the girl min she put us back at the very end of the list instead of the top So my husband let s go we won t get to see the sunset and that s the only reason we came here and leaving Then suddenly they had a table around the corner and the manager had the server show us the table It was in a great spot so we stayed However after the server got us our it took min before he took our order that he still got at least dish wrong and had to be corrected Needless to say this is a place you only go once or if you have visiting No wonder the whole area is turning into a ghost townAlways a first NEVER in my life have I been to leave a table to make room for other after spending well over a hundred on a meal love the place ambience and food but will NOT come back to a place this rude not like there was a lack of tables I open tables on our way out Not sure if they think they are in LA they re notDo I feel that the two star rating is fair Maybe not The view is worth the the service and the food is worth star three to friendly and is unfair so it is The saying I more then not is you don t go to the Oasis for the food you go for the view and if you re lucky the sunset and its a million dollar view I just think they could do much better with their foodThe only thing great about this place is the view as other have The service the food table setup all leave a lot to be desired AND the are too high But I guess you have to pay to play It is a very very big restaurant and it s just sad that after waiting for for a table the food and service t be better I mean even the bar area where you wait is not good tables are left dirty and not up The management obviously taken on too much and this is now in my opinionI only come for the view to show the lake I warn them the food is awful The service is bad to mediocre There is dancing on nights with the band The Brew during the warmer If you come for and the view it s a trip Consider a meal elsewhereIf it t for the and pleasant staff this would be one star only because I leave a zero star review is pretty tacky Dining are very loud even at full Menu is pretty boring and over priced Food is even worse my wife s was over and full of inedible They the half eaten but no discount or offer to remedy Definitely disappointed given how well known this place is I might come back for a drink but if I really want the view I d check out the brewery next door firstThe are strictly for the view which we got to enjoy for over while we for a table after they definitely forgot about us My whole family came in from the east coast to celebrate a big birthday This was supposed to be the birthday dinner and our last night together They were hesitant to drive all the way out here to eat but I was SO excited about it I on it Then after getting here they told us it would be about an hour and a half but probably sooner because people would start leaving when the sun set Over later we re still standing around waiting my pregnant sister sitting on the tired and uncomfortable and a staff member on her break us the bar is When we told her we were still waiting for our table she down to the host stand and us down We re seated as they re cleaning up all the tables around us but still that they forgot about us We ordered because we were and it took probably for the order of that t come close to reaching of us We all sat there silent and uncomfortable and eventually ate some cold food while they turned off all the and finished cleaning around us Pretty good way to ruin a birthday last night with family in town At least the view was pretty for a little while If you re going to be this far away from any other you should at least takeIt s rare I give a low rating review but our past several at the Oasis have been so disappointing I feel to share to help avoid it We been to the Oasis many times over the past it expanding and getting and The food quality was never outstanding but it was good paired with that sunset it was worth the drive and money The food quality with the expansion mediocre at best and food came out cold the last two times we were there I always give the benefit of the doubt and assume it was a single isolated event if our food is cold it was a busy night but the next time all of our were cold food and not happy with their meal The are like sweet really watered down to top it off our server was really rude even rolled her when one of our told her the food was cold her response we re busy The are for the view can t beat that view but we re done with the Oasis zero charm leftThe food here is just at best I have been with and last time I went with my family who was visiting from out of town No one ever got a meal that they about my niece did not seem to care for hers and it was one of the most expensive on the menu It s a place for a meal like a hamburger They could use a fresh spin on My guess is that either the Executive chief is being limited in his or they get so much business that they just don t care The only thing anyone was how nice the scenary was If your coming here remember the service is also super slow you will have to deal with it The real letdown is their For the price of these they should taste good Its a nice place to out with but your better off tea and getting the real elsewhere Sometimes I think their are just without the booze If your going to get a drink have them make you something specific on the If your going to build something that so many people then have the back end setup to handle itare famous for Lake Food When all of your budget goes to paying for the view there s not much left over for a talented head chef Food is mediocre on a good day BUT if you want a place to drink with a nice view this is the place So my are solely based on the food If I were to review this as an outdoor bar I d call it a was an inside jobView is great food is good but nothing special service is The food was pretty slow and our waiter got three out of eight wrongGreat place to see the sunset but the were so strong we t even enjoy them The food was not good I guess if you only want to drink water and watch the sunset this would be a great place Why t they want to serve really good food and a great drink They would make so much more money I don t care to go backThe view is five for sure You can find the same view other the food leaves much to be desired My came out mooing and then it took to get the new one were same as you can get anywhere and my friend s were nothing special or really good Our server was very attentive to the point of becoming annoying He was young and energetic told we did not need to hear about the kitchen I will go again but just to the bar level onlyThis place an amazing view over Lake Travis It s the main reason someone would actually go there because the food is absolutely awful There is no attempt at making decent food Best advice would be to go on a full stomach and just haveOne star for the view one star for the location right on top of a hill over looking a lake The t worthy of that location because the food is beyond awfulI think H s review of May th is spot on The Oasis t what it used to be go there for the view the music maybe for the but never for the foodA group of us met at the Starlight Terrace third floor of Oasis restaurant to see one of our favorite play on night The view is great and the music is fun There is no cover charge The parking is better since the parking garage and valet is reasonable There is no A C in the Starlight terrace so it kind of warm in the late spring summer time BEWARE no matter how big your table is no matter if people come and go there are NO SEPARATE and no even if you ask before This is a BIG HASSLE for our large group I understand the wait staff is only following policy and I am sure they get a lot of heat from perturbed I would happily tip the on a separate check heck I would tip extra You would think that as much money as this place they could develop a way to handle separate My advice Order your from the barSecond time at this establishment and again was not This time the food server my to a table next to me then tried to retrieve it after it was handled by the other guest and to place it on my table Our waiter was even worse Only seen him three times during our visit Once to take our serve us our and then to mysteriously disappear with our credit for a total of fifteen before with our In this day and age with criminal i e identity theft debit credit card abuse card skimming a diner should expect the server to return expeditiously with a bill and credit card Perhaps the owner should invest in a different point of sale system that can be table side in front of a dinerUsed to be a great place The view is awesome but the and food areI to give this place but thinking about it overall it needs a lot of work talk about the good stuff Its in a newly shopping center which is still mostly empty The center is beautiful and this restaurant from its overall appearance is very nice The restaurant itself is MASSIVE And it amazing There are lots of and the service was pretty good Here s the not so good stuff The food was mediocre Not a whole lot of flavor I thought is known for good but this place does it no justice Then take a closer look at the appearance of this place its run down Torn dirty worn out tables like they just don t maintain this place Now the view is also great looking out at the lake but don t look straight down The cliff is full of trash I mean come on your are going to see that spend some money to keep that area clean I understand its probably hard to clean on a cliff but if you chose to build a restaurant there then you should be ready to deal with the the up keep in and around Overall don t go here if your going for food and view I t try next door but you can and see if its any better The place like it probably very busy in the by people who want to drink and party while on the lake So I m sure thats a good thing to do there otherwise probably not worth going toView is really good is really good Food is pretty mediocre though and a tad expensive Would be nice if they had a higher quality more sophisticated menu especially for a place like where the scene is everything Update Did I say food was mediocre I think that s being too generous Before my last outing to the Oasis I t know it was possible for a salmon filet to be rubbery how did they pull that one off My salmon dish was tough a little cold and flavorless If I m not mistaken I think they add automatic gratuity to the bill not cool It s really a shame that a place with such a stellar view horrible foodI haven t even tried the food yet and I know this place is all about the view anyway but after driving over an hour to get there struggling for parking and then being told it was a hour wait for a table we should have AT THE VERY LEAST been able to peek out at the view for but the view saidGo for the View and a Brew and maybe dessert Not sure what the Oasis is trying to be food wise but some is sorely I always said I love a restaurant until now My and my b f s ordered medium came quite rare I ate around the outside but he t take it and sent them both back first time ever The second round was but no flavor or seasoning What an expensive disappointment and from someone who always to find the good in whatever the best part was home the plastic the perfect size for ice tea Dear Oasis you can t just let the view do all the work Come up with a great idea and do one thing GREAT maybe just and dessert and great our waitress was very nice and the manager us on the saying Well I always order mine well done WHAT are you My guy meat a much better at home and you don t tell a meat guy THATFirst time in Totally worth the drive for the view but mediocre food and I had the frozen and it melted in with the heat It was extremely salty and tasted like tequila and very over priced for salty ugh that Sweet thoughWe went on a and the restaurant was very busy We about an hour to be seated Luckily there is a lot to look at and kind of keep you while waiting When we were seated it was outside with a really great view I think that was honestly the best experience was just the view The waiter was really great also It was so busy and you could tell he was really trying to keep everyone happy If he was running behind and was sure to apologize every chance he could and would make and try to have fun That made the waiting for everything better Once we ordered we had to wait a very long time to actually get the food I got the chopped brisket sandwich and it was good but not the best Every one else to enjoy the food but we all agreed it s over priced for what you re getting The view and atmosphere is definitely worth a trip to the restauranthour wait at on a night The manager was laying on the stair case The were approaching random people if they would like to be seated what How about you go in the order as people were waiting What s the point of a waiting list if you don t refer to it When we were finally seated it took about before our waiter came out What we ordered with beef dish of the night it was good Redfish with rice and over and fish had texture of chicken onion soup like gravy with stale of bread this was decent greasy but not too bad Service was mediocre Server t pay attention to like a spoon should be with soup or of I m sure the view is gorgeous we went at night so not much to see but honestly that might be about the only thing you would come here for So many better to try inTwo for the view and free cup That is all poor service and mediocre food the best thing was the and chips I appreciate the time I had but I would warn anyone going to ONLY come for the viewGreat view but service and food t very good especially with higher than I d like to payThis is not a review it is a plea to please please improve the food You have such a great location that it me back when we have in town But I always have to warn them that the food is terrible and just stick to the I suggest you go for a drink here and eat somewhere else Anywhere else At least until my plea isFood was good and the view was great but TERRIBLE service from our server We sat for without any and was not by her first She did not bring our food to us but watched other people do it and not even ask how the food came out She by multiple times without or up on us We were missing of food and any we for until we were halfway through our meal before she brought it to us We were a big party and we our into about so we if we could get it and she said it is against our policy to do multiple so my sister went inside and and they said it s up to the if they split She seen that and came back out to ask how we to do it We also another for her to split our HORRIBLE SERVICE WILL NOT BE COMING BACK FOR MEDIOCRE FOOD AND SERVICEThis place is strictly for to come see the view and the restaurant must know it too The food is below average funny really because I can cook better than that In fact if you come prepared knowing the food is not great it will make the experience a tad better We re talking Cabana level food but double the price Their however are decent We been here twice with family and from out of town We were seated outside at a table with a metal bar that blocked the view I if we could sit at the very next table It was literally the next table with no obstruction at all Hostess said no due to the rotation of tables what This was at a time when the tables t even close to full Minus the view the restaurant really nothing Plus we never seen a place that t at least try to accommodateMy rating is going to be on the food and service The family and I went here as the last meal before they went back to I must say the Oasis is a beautiful place and this was my first time out there I ordered the Spicy Beef w and wild rice I m guessing the rice was I can honestly say I was not happy with my meal Those were GROSS and the were just The red sauce on them was even I still stand by El as my go to place for low priced and good I did love the chips and dip they us And they give you a BIG container of dip to take home along with chips for FREE That was pretty shocking but I was glad because that dip is awesome I also ordered some sort of strawberry cheesecake and I must say that was delicious but For they should go all out on the cheesecake They have this place set up so horribly and what I mean is they have the tables right in front of the that are on high power The chips and everything kept blowing off the table That NO SENSE to have it set up that way I want to enjoy my food on the table and not on the floor And by the way there really was no point in it on because it just hot hair It was so muggy and hot out there Our waitress was very nice and attentive The other were also nice So service chips and dip and cheesecake were of and and dining set up were is being generousBesides the beautiful view of lake Travis there s really nothing special about this place food which is not even good at all I ordered the shrimp for and it was just basically shrimp wrapped in bacon Nothing special to it Awful Awful Not coming back here againstar for the view star for good service for horrible food and I ordered the Hatch Chicken and it was pink and when I cut into it I notified our waiter and he quickly took it back to the kitchen for a new plate Our waiter was very nice about the issue and for the inconvenience He brought back an entirely new plate but when I cut into it again it was still and pink Hopefully they t serving all of their chicken Would have them to take this entree off of my checkThe View is amazing But not amazing enough to justify the ridiculous on the food Seriously for soggy and I am NOT a picky eater This place is a local favorite and everyone should go at least once in their to see the sunset but don t expect good food I did attend a wedding reception here a few ago and we had a really great time The open bar might have had something to do with thatGreat view but that s where the greatness Food is not good and service is justThe view would get out of But this place seriously needs new management or a wake up call service is so slow and they act like it s normal They were not busy Tables t it s a mess One of the best if not the best in Absolutely beautiful I can t remember waiting longer for food And the quality of the was worse than for more Great place for scenery But one of the worst service I ever had So much potential Don t expect good food but get an appetizer and enjoy the viewSo been wanting to bring my wife out here to the Oasis for of the lake and to see what it was all about I thought Mother s Day would be a good day to do so and had already made beforehand One word of advice to anyone anywhere when making to a place you never been do the research and ask the to find out about and if you can get a certain table near where you can actually see the lake So we came here and were lucky enough to get parking so off well Got to the buffet and they confirmed our reservation and then sat us down out in the open nowhere near the lakeside I won t even say what was up with that considering they could have sat us in the lakeside view area My wife kind of t like that Let s just say that for the most part the food was good Fruit tasted like it was fresh the salad was good the there was good but probably could have had some better bread My wife and I took part in both breakfast and lunch that day The band was but at no time were they so we t even know who they were Then they gave us the bill and I was pretty inflamed that that it came out to be just under with that or whatever gratuity on I mean per person for Mother s Day I am not sure how everyone who had was able to eat there today they must have out of their a That took away my appetite and all of a sudden the food we had eaten t taste good Then they tried to charge us for each we had when the bartender himself had said it was a special The waitress went to talk to him then the manager came and in the end he ended up giving us back in cash because of the misunderstanding I guess I misunderstood how this place was and their food was good but it t worth the money we considering we t even get a lakeside view When we left the buffet and around the Oasis it clear that there were other we could have eaten and I felt in general that my wife was saying I told you so in her mind but sometimes she t always tell me outright and I know now for like this it s best to just come and walk around and take in the view and to bring your own food or There is no justification for paying a gratuity onto a per person buffet no matter how great the view is I honestly have to say it is the only time we went there and likely will be the last time we ever go thereFood is good But If u are coming to eat within an hour and a half of Boy are u in for a surprise You pay for the view and atmosphere NOT THE FOOD AND SERVICE I ordered and appetizer and the food came later with the appetizer I sent the appetizer back When your server comes to bring any thing or check on u Be prepared to give him a list I that u need Even anticipatory or it be before u see your server again Otherwise u will be they for a minimum of hour dinner that should have taken an hour at bestGreat average food and very slow service We had an area we wished to sit with plenty of seating dining there but seated elsewhere even after I our no courtesy given to our desired seating I d understand if they were busy but they t Even so they could indicate wait time for our seating wish nearly for a drink reorder Good service is definitely not top priorityThe food was sub par Not worth the money for sure The pina was good and I feel like totally worth the cost especially since you can keep the glass but the were not worth the price or worth the long walk from my carA place like this with a view like that zero excuse to serve food as mediocre to bad as it does The are just But in all seriousness the food is awfulThis is our or th visit here since moving to last year Each time we visit it like the food quality is and the service is poor The band tonight and the other nights we have been here are always awesome Food and service are suffering tremendously I guess when you have a lake sunset view you really don t have to focus on service and foodNice view Food alright but NOT worth the price at all Service abysmally awfully terribly pathetically s l o w I can say I been there now that s about it I would go back on another trip but probably spring or fall near sunset and just get an appetizer and or a drink Food just not worth itRolling up to the Oasis it s not clear if this is real life or a scene of the future ala Back in my day The Oasis was a nifty little spot with sprawling wooden Sure the food would punch you in the stomach and pillage your wallet but the view made up for it Of course you had to park a mile away on an unpaved lot Lake Travis actually had water in it Those were the days man Then along came a lightning bolt got a little at The Oasis and I m not talking about the The Oasis rose from the ashes but this was not a phoenix story A monstrosity grew And what rough beast its hour come round at last towards to be born This beast was big Oasis is bloated It is no longer just a restaurant with some It is a monument to where if some is good then a ton is The parking situation is and the view is almost as good as it was Water are way down but a little marketing could fix the problem Come see Lake Travis the land of a thousand sand Oasis is a place that and love to hate I m all for getting out the and but let s not overstate the case The Oasis development is gaudy and transparently designed to get giddy on terrible a then lighten their The much food is not that bad It s garden variety The problem is the price Beef for for Are you Do you know what can buy at a place like Jack s Kitchen or Salty Sow If you slashed the menu by across the board then the value might be reasonable But then how would they pay the rent and on this monstrosity Now it becomes clear Like it or not The Oasis is an institution and it is a place that can be with the right You don t have to be by the The view and chips and are free I say come on down grab a beer skip most of the menu and marvel at this monument to capitalism and at the wondrous Lake TravisFood bland Capitalism present View cool White people prevalent Staff see previous there where If you re going to eat at Oasis be prepared for chewy meat hard and suspicious Eat outside so the view of Lake Travis yourThe and view are worth the drive to this treasure However the menu is minimal and the food is average for price per mealAwful Eve and actually not busy but our service was horrible was our waiter and some how they screwed up our order of not once but twice We just decided not to eat at the Oasis and to just pay for our so we can get out of dodge Well he brought out the receipt with two order of on it when we actually only ordered one but we did not eat it we sent it back because they t follow Staff defiantly needs some training I should of known better after reading the which are all true The food on the menu is moderate quality over priced The view is awesome Come for the viewThis place is gorgeous and it s all about the visual experience and the service was very weak Very new and contemporary with a stunning view but I don t plan on ever dining here againMissing the mark The th restaurant in the world Three of one of the most beautiful in A spectacular place for an event and then the food The chicken and the consistency of tuna The lack zing but are The fish fall way short almost fearful to eat The taste like a them and thought pepper was to spicy The beef a good option but Parking arcade room would be awesome with a small make over Every station in back could have a chef make over and if the owner stepped out of the way and let and the other create the menu or revamp the food would be kicking If they added and had a lounge for college during off season then bam bam made an area for the to be while relaxed bam bam But instead they choose food taste and texture fail friendly fail college friendly fail awesome atmosphere fail Take note Oasis at least you have a good view but strangely enough you probably would have tried to screw that up tooThe food is as are the I had an eight dollar mixed drink which was for the price I used to go before the fire and have to say that I was then but not now They seem to have gotten too big because it very to me They are part of a shopping mall However I like the view and the dance floor is greatMy wife and I have eaten here twice Make no mistake the place is cool The view is amazing and the layout and outside keep you somewhat interested while waiting for a table Both times we forever for a table and went all the way up top for some while waiting The were good but very Once we were seated it took about to get our order in and then hour and to get our food The food was not good just I would agree that it is up there with what you would expect from a chain place on a very busy night but at times the cost We limit this place to a nice evening out with out of town when they are payingFood was o k They obviously focus on quantity i e of people quality Service was extremely slow Had a minute wait for a party of One person got their food about before everyone else No sign of a manager on tables to make sure the were with their service Great place for the if you re with sub par servicethe view is great But the food and service is terrible I recommend going for an adult beverage and the view but dining somewhere else Even then the mixed are not all that good and watered down so order a beer or wine The service Some of the wait staff are total The last time we were there with another couple we for a half hour for our food We were done eating for before the waitress ever back up again By that time our were empty and we just to leave We the waitress to split the check She was a total snot in her snippy response of We don t split so just tell me what amount you want run on each card UGH That was the last straw It s not difficult Most split If your food system can not handle split then get one that does We lived in the area for and have been to the Oasis a couple dozen times Now we been there done that The food is still and the service is We won t be backEat BEFORE you come Without the lake and sunset this place would not be in business Must have really terrible management because the is all very young who seem miserable The food is also not be desiredmany of the here but the only real reason I would come here is the view We had to wait for around for dinner on a night and when we did get our table our party of five was seated at a huge table for To make worse it was very loud and crowded and there was a fan blowing mist into my face the entire night When we to switch tables they said we would have to sign up on the again so we decided to just deal with it The sunset was really nice over the lake and the food t bad but definitely not note worthy The for the chicken we got were a bit hard although the chicken was relatively tender and not bad The fish were pretty average and the were a bit small and unspectacularThere were of us for dinner last June We found a table on the floor with the band The band was good and very entertaining Food was but nothing to write home about We had and The bad experience came towards the end of the night The band stopped and they were about to close I stood up and went to the While I was gone one of the female wait staff told my You get out of here My friend that they were just waiting for me to come back In the there were a few tables still and some are casually walking towards the exit This staff then my friend that they should leave and wait outside My friend politely the staff that they d rather wait for me there at the table To this the staff them and said that the are already on the way It is at this point that I got back and tried to defuse the I convinced my friend to just walk out with me While we see the So this is how OASIS I was to bring here when they visit in but I guess it s better for us not to get simply because the staff are rude and can t waitGosh I almost feel bad about giving this place two I want to give it three but I just can t justify it The chips and were so so the food was the were weak and the service was pretty bad It s too bad really since it a great location the lake from high above But it is what it is and after scanning some other Yelp after the fact it I m not alone I went with a decent sized group after work about people total We d actually intended to to the place next door an uncle place out of respect I leave the name out of this review but they were closed on a with new winter snaps Dern it Ah well the whole area is beautiful and clearly intended to dazzle In fact I took of the courtyard area just outside The Oasis as it was just beautiful and lush filled with interested And then we went in walking past a grand staircase and a really cute bar area with wicker that just for you to sit relax sip and talk with The place t that busy so we got a nice table outside with the lake Gorgeous And so that s all the good stuff I skip to the of what I t like about The Oasis as no matter how well you tell a bad story it s still a bad story Ours with an extremely long drink process We were assigned one waiter but he had and yet it was a good from when we sat down until they for It was at this minute mark that we also got the chips and The chips were wonderful but the just so so It t spicy nor that flavorful and so the went largely untouched beyond This is a gourmet restaurant my word not theirs which in and a few token sandwich It was another until the food came out I had the Mar with shrimp and in a lobster sauce It was but small I finished my meal quickly and the chips some more waiting for the waiter again to ask for a refill You know it s bad when the talk around the table from the beautiful view to lack of flavor in the meal and then worse anyone seen the waiter in awhile And so it went Now I don t normally look at my watch too much while dining out But I will mention this last part because it will emphasis the of the service At around my friend me for the time We were a car on this trip and we were trying to get to Best Buy before they closed at Ah it s Plenty of time Or so I thought We were done eating you see We were waiting for the waiter to return so we could ask for the check It took someone going inside about later to get him to come out He informed us that policy was to not split the tab so we all dug out cash or and d up It t bad and it only took us or so Oddly we all watched somewhat and yet also as the waiter took it all inside and stood in front of the cash register computer for a good or What could be taking him so long enter the cash total and ring up the on the credit That was after all exactly what he d recommend we do all the time he said And so around we finally got our back and the restaurant In case you were curious we did make it to Best Buy with to spare Go usThe Oasis should be pretty high on your list of to take out of town but not a place to visit with any regularity unless you live or work nearby As of the rebuild parking is easy enough However the food is still flat out lousy and it s still just a mass production bar However the alcohol is alcoholic and the fried food is still fried so sit back and enjoy the amazing sunset if you up early enough to get a lakeside seatAn iconic figure in but a historically disappointing one The and view have never been a question but the food time and time again The service is often poor and not the most friendly inviting atmosphere In all I can think of many many to eat in over the Oasis Unless you are just looking for some happy hour look at other on the lakeAs the atmosphere is electric and the view is absolutely spectacular Unfortunately similar to other the food is less than stellar We t venture but there are other to eat in the complex The is eclectic and diverse I recommend visiting just eat elsewhere We are to a really good band while waiting on the fabulous sunsetThe food was good but the service was terrible My server like we were annoying her although we t do anything to her yet She stood with arms akimbo the whole time taking order and her voice t polite at all Haven t experience anything like this before server I ever seen She the same way with different tables too With the price we we thought we would have been in a better way May come back for the view but just order couple ofThe food is mediocre at best and incredibly Incredible of you sit outside though Likely that I won t go backMy entree sat under a heat lamp so long the enchilada sauce dried solid and my rice was crunchy My Margarita just tasted like straight Chi Chi s non alcoholic mixer The other six me agreed never again In fact we re we t leave the second we After a while of being there I to feel like this is one of the most annoying and to eat felt like I was in a mall Beautiful view of the lake and gorgeous sunset thoughThe view from our table was great but the was all olive juice and we sent it back The was just with a dab of tomato The shrimp small tiny shrimp not very flavorful and the beef was a tiny portion If I I would not eat but spend my time at the wineryGreat view That s about it service Good thing they brought the chips My favorite was the they brought out AFTER we the bill which they up Also noteworthy is my needing to wave down the waitress TWICE to set up an umbrella Food was generally edible The salmon dish I had was mediocre I m very glad I got the shrimp cream sauce on the side and doubled up on the spinach The are a bit on the high side considering the lack of quality Also noteworthy is the sheer monstrosity of a tourist trap this place is A restaurant with multiple a guest shop a parking garage and a bunch of other very random to walk around and admire It would seem they re trying to make this place a part of the experience Mission accomplishedUnfortunately the food and service ruined a spectacular view We an hour and a half for our food which finally came cold and There were of mix and we thought the music was too loud which at Our waitress was trying her best but the ordeal was less than enjoyable quite a shame since the view was why we chose this placeI have been to the Oasis a few times and the only reason I go back is because of the view The restaurant experience is horrible The are rude and pay no attention to their Service is very slow and the menu is weakI really wish the food here was better We had a mix of brisket sandwich red fish and All of the food was mediocre at best The brisket sandwich had more bread that meat I mean we are in so what s the excuse here I was I d get big steak and got a version of the Long Silver s variety The view is beautiful and the only reason to go I d be here more often if they could fix their menu and food quality I expect more for the priceThis restaurant was only good for the view my and I both had hair in our food and I never got a refill on my drink for the hour and half I was there I would suggest eating somewhere else then go there just for The view is very pretty and chips and are goodOasis I want to love you Your are amazing of the Your are cold Your work great and the help beat the heat The deck set up is amazing But your food It still it still My took me here for Father s Day because we were in the area out by the lake the sun was going down and we were We went here and I will say the chips and were pretty good I was pleasantly Then everything after that was not great I had the steak and it was well but the sauce was too sweet It was a decent cut of meat which I found surprising but I t like the flavor that much The sides were plain and bland My barely ate any of her shrimp and she shrimp They were sadly very over and tough Nor did she want to box up anything and neither did I I almost ALWAYS finish my plate I HATE wasting food and I left about of it uneaten The service here was really good our waitress was awesome and I would give them mainly because our server was great she was smiling and got everything right But if I have to go up to or down to I m definitely going down on this one We saw her politely bear the rude of some with aplomb I to go over there and pour my beer on their The food runner that brought me my steak t bring a steak knife and when my another waiter for a steak knife he said I think we re out She said Try doing better than that Bring me a knife please Our waitress finally brought me one and not her fault but I got to sit there and look at my steak getting cold for a while rather than eat it like a cave man As we were leaving the that the staff that bus the tables use were like three high outside the of what I assume was the upstairs dishwashing area and they were all over the floor It was gross I know they were busy but wow I am going to try the Oasis Brewing restaurant and bar next time then maybe go to the Oasis at sunset for a beer One beer But don t come here to eat JustThe only good thing in here is the view anything else so much there are no to describe The food are really bad it s not authentic and it s either too salty or too greasy It s just all of bad The two are basically because it got an awesome viewA great place to watch the sunset with a cocktail or a beer but not such a great place to eat The menu was small mostly a hod podge of and food My sister and I both went for it would be a safe bet Not so much We both received made which were kind of bland and pretty awful The other at our table t seem too with their either On the plus side I did get a giant souvenir Hurricane glass with my cocktail So it t all bad Again the view was really pretty even the drive up there was nice I d definitely recommend heading up for but drive back toward town to eat dinner way to many good to waste a meal out on dried outUnbelievable view but the are terrible Shocking a place this cool doesnt know how to make the number one drinkgood for and a view of the sunset on lake travis but I prefer my to not have skin on itamazing Food My advice is to simply order a drink or two maybe get a dessert and call it good The service is always slow lack luster and all around lazy The food super cheap almost like a step up from style dining It is a great place to go for a unique date or to take visiting family and but don t expect great food Just walk around take and check it off the bucket listCame here with the on a horribly gloomy day I was so excited to show him this place as far as aesthetics its very impressive the Unfortunately it was a cold and rainy day and he was in a lot of pain as he threw out his back nights We had just tore up brunch at Frank s so we were only up fro As it was cold I had a hot chocolate with and it was fantastic We had a nice server albeit he was like the server in office space that was supposed to emulate He also for a long time The whole place was run by I didnt see one adult on site in our visit With that in mind they are not professional talking about their personal business about getting high after work while they are clearing tables It just the place town As far as the the lake was almost bone dry more land than water No longer much of a view at all AND it was a ghost town inside It s just not what it used to be If you re only in town for days dont bother If you re there for a week give it a shot maybe you get lucky with the weather view and or serviceGreat view Good Chips and good frozen margarita Great service for a group of people on a for lunch Food was bad None of the group was satisfied with the quality I had the shrimp too spicy but not in a good way and rice were cold and bland Good forLet me save you the trouble of whether or not to eat here while you view the sunset don t stay for the food as it s mediocre at best and way Save yourself some time unless you like waiting to eat and money for go up to the brewery have a few watch the sunset then go somewhere else to eatWow Went out to the Oasis to grab lunch with my wife It had been awhile since we had been there but we were in the area so thought we would grab some and enjoy the view I have to say that the food was fine Not great but not bad The view was still as good as ever But the over the top construction to what used to be a cool restaurant with a weird pool and a bunch of laid back wooden now being converted into a town Oasis What the heck I understand they had a fire several back and wooden are probably not the best idea but really a four story convention center or large meeting space a story parking garage new huge on the edge of the rim of the lake that are not even to be blended in with the surrounding tree Are there not any building to protect the from the lake I can only imagine how bad it will look if the rest of that hilltop the same way that the Oasis is doing it SadOh how I wish they would just make better food As an local I don t come here very often mainly because the some sort of strange unlike anywhere else in and the food is ABYSMAL However the are phenomenal and unlike any other place in town Our server was quick and kind the food however left us wanting more Would recommend coming here during off season really not worth it to wait around during the in of getting a decent table with a nice view just to be low quality foodFood does not have flavor and is not Go to this restaurant only for the view and not for the foodI was a guest here yesterday and I ordered the classic which was not bad most definitely not the best but not the worst just We also order the chicken and this is when when down hill for me The chicken inside these was slightly and pretty much raw If I come back it s because the view is gorgeous and the look good big so you get a good portion for your buck I t able to try one but they look good I WILL NOT come back for the food Our waitress was nice and she took care of us even after this incident they took the appetizer out of our tab which was nice of them but I could gotten salmonellaMy first time going was a HUGE disappointment I went with my and our significant along with my total people I got the all medium well It might as well have been well done because that was the driest bland meat ever My sister got the entree with chicken She said the and chips were so salty she t even finish her plate Everyone else about the food as well The only good thing food wise was the and chips It t even that busy when we went around and the waitress still took a really long time to come to our table to either fill our or bring whatever we Like long At the end of the night we tried splitting the check between two and we whose card to charge for what and The waitress simply t understand how we split it so she just the however she thought would be Which is horrible customer service She should have come back to the table and us to clarify it for her but she t One of my brother in got more than half of the bill and the other person was the remainder I think she did very wrong in doing it however she saw fit Very disappointed in the whole experience would not like to return any time soonFood is awful are good View is awesome Go for and the view Get some chips and if you need something with your but skip the rest of the menuBeautiful restaurant and a nice outdoor level deck however with the low Lake Travis water level the view is just plain sad by the serene water are sand which bring a constant reminder that s water are The art and all the is very and if that is what you are into then maybe it s worth the drive The food and are just and over priced even for a touristy spot I can t think of any food or that stand out as being good hereYou are paying for the view The food is bland but then again if you are here then you probably came for the view I can spend watching the panoramic view of the lake from their balcony One time we came here right at sunset and it was amazing watching the sun go down over the water This summer the water level was historically low so the view was more depressing than amazing but i imagine it once the lake up it will be beautiful againWe went here with a party of The line was long it like it was for an amusement park exaggerating but it was a long wait The view was amazing he only reason why I would go Food t good and over price were Service was bad took forever for our waiter to get to us I order steak was too spicy I like the they But I t come backService was slow It took the waiter to get to our table so we just decided to take our food to go The food was nothing special The only reason to come here is the view which is the only saving grace of this restaurantThe only reason it is b c of the service which is excellent but otherwise the food is mediocre Nothing great about this place go to sIf you want a great view of Lake Travis and horrible food this is the place for you There is no its the best place to watch the sunset on the lake however I think better food than this place I d advise going there to watch the sunset and have a good but drink and leaving it at thatFirst thing to consider is that what you see as The Oasis now is NOT what it originally was so those who remember the old Oasis sorry After a fire a few ago the rebuilt something scary in its place The old Oasis was a fun place a good ways from town it was a destination with great and a tradition where everyone clapped at sunset I was a the first time I went and back then when there was almost nothing between and this place The lake was high out here were rural and it was just a ramshackle fun spot to go to So time I went off to college got married and my own family here by this point late s it had a little bit but the food quality was suffering It was a spot people went to specifically for the view They t put a lot of effort into the food because there was still going to be a market for the Oasis even if it it was average and that s just lazy A few more pass and though you don t go a great dining experience it s still a fun place to bring out of town plus there was an art gallery antique shop in a house next door and a new music venue though I was never there when a band was I m not even sure the parking lot was completely I went last week for the first time in probably and t recognize it The hostess it was a totally new building on the site of the original which burned down some ago I had completely forgotten The are the same so that s neat but it s not just a restaurant It s a sprawling complex with various like a little village but with an odd western interpretation It s what an architect who had never actually been here would imagine was like The whole situation is so so weird and even a little creepy and the all over the front entranceway give me the The food is still mediocre at best the lake is tragically low and now rather than beautiful countryside you get to look at bloated the before you go pick up your in the parking structure The PARKING STRUCTURE It s enough to make you cryI agree the best in but the food is terrible high priced and the service is not great One plate of food was ice cold and not like it had down but as in refrigerator coldYou would think this place would hear and or read regarding their service Living in the area that s usually the first thing people mention My opinion is fully aware of the situation but not to address it due to it being a local tourist destination Until the sun to set somewhere else nothing will change On a positive note on a visit last fall with out of town they had a great s cover band upstairs They made it worth the tripThe only reason to go is for the view That said the view is worth the not really good and food but only once a year We do get some really good here and when people visit from out of country they get a good laugh when people clap for the sunset In addition since you can get beer that really everything more tolerable t it I usually eat dinner before we go so I don t have to stomach anything other than chips and with my beer Their margarita s are but I prefer the beer with lime occasionally Service is typically than catsup in the old fashioned glass bottle So bring your patienceWhat You NEED to know The food is downright horrible You re going to overpay Immensely for a plate of small shrimp are with cheap cocktail nothing fresh or homemade The view is wonderful even if our poor lake is almost empty as of summer Many wonderful outdoor tables with a great view biggest outdoor restaurant The building complex is huge with other and but they might struggle to stay open Ample parking in There s a bar upstairs in Oasis with live music dancing In my opinion the only way to enjoy this place is to eat first and go enjoy a beer straight liquor or agua with those you love for conversation Not much can get in the way of thatI was excited to go for the st time for my birthday I had to use the ladies room when we first into this impressive venue The is sadly in need of We were seated outside and the view was Our table was unbalanced so we had to find something to fix that Strawberry margarita was great Not much of a menu I had cheese and that part was good but and rice canned My grandson s hamburger bun was hard Service was friendly but slow and was Everyone I told that I had been taken to the Oasis had the same response oh wow its nice but the food t good That s a shameI concur with the consistent not so awesome An friend brought another friend with her to the area and she to show him around The Oasis like a decent place only due to scenery Its definitely a nice drive going there and they have built quite an impressive but its such an impersonal approach to dining out When walking up to the restaurant I felt like I was following and just like I would at an which is why I hate But we were seated quickly at a nice spot to overlook the lake on this very sunny day an umbrella might have been a nice touch Chips and barely mediocre were We ordered which was probably a block of melted that we spiced up on our own with the mediocre and S P Two of us ordered the shrimp and the themselves were quite edible but the straight out of the can and the sprinkle of rice on my plate were I will say the service we received there though a bit slow at times was alright No huge there If they spiffed up their menu a bit they might have a real reason other than just the scenery to get people out thereThis one really rounding to an even star it just sorry I am a big fan of atmosphere and this place it I LOVE the sun and that is really why you go here If you don t love the sun blazing down on you then there are lots and lots and lots and lots and LOTS of to try to shade you Which ruin the view All the are another view in themselves but not the view I go there for But why does one go to a restaurant For food and drink of course and this place in all of food and drink Sorry Even the margarita a necessary staple for an establishment centered around sitting in the sun the lake was awful I am pretty sure it was nothing but watered down sour mix And I even to a premium margarita The only food that I have had there worth eating was the crispy chicken sandwich which was super spicy and actually flavorful unlike anything else I have had there So do I go again Yeah sometimes when I have Because it is still a great view And sitting in the sun will exhaust the family and they will just want to go home and take a nap so I don t have to deal with themi d have to say this place is a little a lot it s true you have a great view of lake travis and if you go around dinner time the sun setting over the lake but thats about all you be getting out of your visit there the food is not good nor are the you experience that this place a very feel especially now that they re expanding and building a shopping center next to the restaurant it be a little city full of goods there are other even around lake travis where you can watch the sunset and with GOOD food i know everyone to recommend this place but seriously there s no need to even experience it once my advice go somewhere elseSo the view was gorgeous The were great After that everything The food was just we had a two year in our party who was her second birthday and they to sing for her Please get over yourselves if the at can sing so can you This was on Memorial Day weekend and her dad had just returned from and her first birthday however they don t sing We also came with the of Amy s ice cream when I for some I was with Go got the view however eat beforehandIt is so true The only thing amazing about this place is the view you get especially during Sunset It is truly awesome Other than that The food is not that fantastic and the are to high for the quality of the food Besides the some people are driving from as little as up to an hour to go there and its just not worth the drive at all Its really disappointingYou come here for their perfect location and This property Lake Travis and the view is stunning I have watching a number of from their patio That being said the food here room for much improvement The food void of any flavor or quality Almost all or of mine say the same when We got the because nothingThis restaurant is kind of mediocre and expensive consider yourself Probably the worst I ever had Dry plastic like taste was old Too much cheese that tasted cheap Meat was really chewy The Grill a million times better for a fraction of the cost But The view is gorgeous IF you don t mind getting baked in the direct sun that is Bring The amazing view location is what this mediocre place alive thriving and growing they are now even paving their parking lot as I write this like the Oasis love it or hate it is here to stay I d only visit here for some and looking at a sunset over Lake Travis on a weekday are insanely crowded Skip their food take some nice panoramic and then go elsewhere for a much better quality dinnerI had not been back to this location since before the fire Let me set the mood Imagine a place that used to be charming now picture that place was and built their idea of the place This is what to the Oasis It is now a mall sized monster of ugly bronzed Caricature Drawing booth and Everything is over the top and nothing to flow together The is god awful none of the people in our group it There are some very creepy one for example is the guy doing a swan dive over the patio Seriously is up with that its creepy trust me it is Aside from the hideous layout and the food is horrible I had the with sauce if you can call it that YUCK Seriously some of the worst I have had The rice was way and left some red coloring on the plate when it was from it that can t be good The meal was horrible over all fellow guest had his and come out cold Which would make sense it like the closet kitchen was probably a mile away we were on patio I get it you come for the view and atmosphere but still don t charge the you do for such inadequate food Honestly I would have given this place a if not for the and our server The are good worth a pop eh debatable Our server was very friendly I applaud her But everything else I will pass on I don t plan to come back here it really is sad as to what this place become I am just glad I was able to enjoy it during its GLORY prior to becoming a BIG BOX placeFood was good for the price but I was the only person who what I ordered at my table View was beautiful Service was horrible If it t for the fact that we had to ask probably who were not our for service because we t get any service this place would be much better How hard is it to come and take your table s order Or to get some chips and for us before our meal comes Or refill our once Or be around for a to go box and check Apparently that is just too much to ask forNot what it used to be just another thing that screwed up here in that I used to loveIf you are visiting Lake Travis you have to check out the Oasis at Lake Travis at least one night to see the sunset The view is absolutely breath taking watching the sun set across the lake Get there at least an hour before sunset don t get about the line they have a ton of tables the lake We had mixed beer while eating chips Not sure how there good is but everything we saw get appealing The Oasis is the place to be for sunsetCame here on several and the location is stunning The don t do it justice Was what could only be as a smear of mayonnaise inside my Coke cup and a watery floppy plate of I ordered the with chicken but no chicken was on the soggy mess Even with the multiple visible with our food no one came and to us about our experience The service was fine not great but it s a shame that the restaurant is ran like it is It s obviously a management issueThe on the menu had so much lime lemon juice that it was nearly undrinkable I t taste anything except tartness it was overwhelming even after most of the ice had melted Really unacceptable The margarita was though and not too sweet If you must come for the view stick with the basic margarita My friend really the margarita with mango puree I think it was a hurricane so that s also an option if you like very sweet You pay for the locationThe are for the beautiful view As for the service it was bad from the minute we walk in Food was average Don t expect too much from the restaurant Just go for the experience and enjoy the view I left before sunset but I bet that view would have been amazingView Only Food was bland at best Once they pay off the loan for the building then maybe they might can afford some better and to pay for a true cooking staff If they even tried on the food they could charge a plate just for the viewThe view star The food is star The device is no This place could be so much more Keep to simple stuff Get a seat in the deck and enjoy the viewHere now food is great Service I have not seen my waitress and the gentleman i for help had no facial expression and completely that I if he could find my waitress This But just now the manager came and gave us our appetizer we already ate the entree She was very nice and she sincere in her apology and I thank her for thatBeautiful but the food and the are ridiculously high The only reason I might return here is for the view However with several recent of surrounding oasis I am not sure I will ever have to come back inside the restaurant to enjoy the view Good thingPLEASE READ I got married at the Oasis in May Beth is helpful but unorganized and in too many The food was better than the restaurant since the caterer is different The view was great Overall it was but we for champagne during our and with Beth not paying attention we t get it and empty glasses The worst part is that they LOST our engraved sign in book so we have of it but never got it When I Beth she like it was no big deal and said no we don t have it They employ teens to clean up so I m sure they it They also kept all of my and she said I should have put my name on them i was never told to do so She said she d buy my next meal for them I m sure they are still them and charging newNothing was great but the view A few after we were seated outside a server came up and us why we were sitting at the table The hostess had just sat us there The server was very openly that we had been seated in her section but I m not sure why They to serve us and we had to be by the server in the neighboring section It t matter which server we ended up with the server we had was fine but it was a very odd situation The food and were fine but You re paying for the nice view Just know that going into it and I m sure you will have an timeWe went to the floor to eat since the wait would be hour at the restaurant Food is not good We got the chicken starter which was good and flavorful One person got the tao meat had no flavor I got chicken and another got beef Totally disappointing I ordered a side of to go I t want to try anything else The scenery and atmosphere is the only thing worth coming here We went and they had live music That was awesomeThe Oasis an amazing view and that s about it The food is objectively terrible and the are not much better Advice stick to appetizer and beer or wine and you won t feel like you been taken to the Sunset is lovely there That s the second starBeautiful view but the food is very bad I have been here a few times and i never like the food no matter what I orderSeriously exactly like all the other say spot on Don t go for the food but go for the view The chips were soggy and the food was overall horribly mediocre and but the view is spectacular You could also tell overall that the wait staff t really want to be there but our hostess was very nice and about finding us a table we were happy with Even though the food is gross I would still go back for the view It is after all a true tourist spotI love how popular this place is despite how much the food Location location location It s a great place to celebrate with beautiful scenery And it s hard to be upset about the food when you can see the and feel the breeze I would invite anyone to come try this place if it s their first time I guess we can talk about the food if you really want to read about it Standard The up quickly if you are eating outside I would suggest getting Mar Pretty good The lobster cream really saved it The rice and tasted like something out of a frozen bag Corn bisque soup I actually really this one soupThere s a theme with these to be seated and to get food Great view but was dark most of time They should take and improve good qualityso over all I agree with the tag line of two I start with the good stuff my waitress was fantastic She did not rush us checked on us appropriately and all around good service Then there is the view which is why there are two and not just one From the picture I added you can tell that it is stunning However the good service and great view are not enough to make me go back After two I t feel event he buzz so the was slight of hand apparently Also as everyone said the food is mediocre at the very best Overall I will not return nor recommend There are plenty of other to get a view of lake travis without payingNot sure why I am writing this review because it s clear that the management t care We knew the place was terrible and went anyway for the view Shame on us As been said before Food is bad They put the label ON THE MENU They may as well just say Everything you eat here will come out of a bag And it like it Got the featured salad the seared must have been seared some days ago because it was ice cold and utterly tasteless Salad was spring mix from the supermarket and the mango pico was a plop of canned mango Service is bad Moody inattentive slow Dude literally just our food on the edge of the table and away wordless Left for inordinate of time to get a spoon No on anything ever Handed me the check mid meal in the most deliberate move I have ever seen We had been there less than are great this is it The lake is still stunning and are well Go if you must maybe when are visiting from out of town It would be a good place to go and drink beer eat but only if you have a driver due to the out of the way location I d give it one star except that it is very pretty That s got to be worth something What a wasted opportunityYou go her for the food and the alcohol Go eat somewhere else before you go to the Oasis Basically I only go here when are in town and I want to show them Lake Travis this place is in business solely for the view I would recommend the Oasis Brewing Company next door Same view without the lousy foodGreat but stay away from the food Potentially the worst food I ever had definitely the worst ofI accept this place for what it is a tourist trap with a spectacular view That being said I will go back But from hence forward I shall remember to ONLY go on beautiful warm weather days And preferably when I have a party of or more because then I can call in and make a reservation In a nutshell the food is nothing great and it is If I can sit outside and enjoy the weather and view then I can forgive the menu And if you are a small party and cannot make then you can expect to wait At least there are to roamIf you re looking for with a beautiful view this is your place If you re looking for good food it might be hit miss There were of us Chicken were a little on the dry side Flour were so under done that they like corn Brought out a new batch they were the same Maybe it s their signature but they were thin doughy Chicken Comes on a bed of rice with black grilled Chicken was cold dry like jerky We sent it back got the salmon instead it was great Smoked chicken we ordered them without the hatch so that could be why they were cotton dry not sure Shrimp were goodView Its nice Plan accordingly for sunset Service did a great job for our party For such a bustling joint she really did her part and even my dad with a free birthday treat Food I already that feeling but ordered the beef plate and were Cheesy stuff usually does the job Extremely by the plate Maybe my bowls of cereal before leaving was a factor On the bright side the flan was well receivedI realize the point of going to the Oasis is to sip a margarita while watching the sunset over the lake Fine It is beautiful but I have to tell you its going to be awhile before I attempt another visit The are good and I m willing to pay it for the however I was there last weekend and it was such a experience The were absolutely horrible Aside from the disorganization the were rude making fun of the and completely unapologetic for giving our table away They us to have a margarita at the bar but the only way to ensure we got our table was to check back every five The worst system I ever seen for an establishment that should know what its doing by now I may try again after the construction is done Dust in my face while waiting behind a hostess stand with little indication about how long my second table will take did not a happy customer make We finally gave up and went to Z instead UghThe food is mediocre at best You definitely are paying for the view when dining herePretty view that s it My food order was up three times one of which was never fixed I was over for my drink which was also mixed up The ladies were beyond gross at least the stall I had the pleasure of to visit At no time was any mistake for nor for they could do so much betterThe Oasis is out of the way and high above Lake Travis The view is spectacular especially at sunset The food is and mediocre However the dessert was delicious and at was really good I would definitely go back for dessert and view That s itMy and I are visiting from and our local said this place the most amazing sunset over Lake Travis with mediocre food and slow service But the sunset would make the trip worth it Their forewarning was On Point The sunset was gorgeous Beautiful And I highly recommend the view or something near by if at all possible Now the We had a margarita and skip the liquor and order beer Trust me Ewe Now the food the chips and are my primary recommendation He chips were warm and crispy and the had a good kick and was great I ordered the smoked chicken and the ordered he pork just say the Cabana I had the night before was times better than both of our here So to review Come for the sunset It s amazing Only order beer and chips andit Worst food I ever had in my life have no alcohol but they act like oh limit only ea As if Chips salty dry yuck one teaspoon of flavorless pinto cheese the same Lettuce On Little piece of fish w a tiny dab of rice Place is a Rip Off Very pretty but what a waste If you seen it once then that s all you need No reason to come backI went here approximately ago and I honestly the view of Lake Travis I experienced food then Fast forward later still food and Lake Travis view was covered up with the overdevelopment I hate the new mall theme The service received was less than stellar My and I for to have my drink taken There is not a fan available outside Overall I think I am going to go downtown Lady Bird Lake and experience better service better food and a fan in the heatOnly two because I t dare spend my money on their terrible and over priced food and drink HOWEVER This is a good dance floor and music venue and some great in front of an awesome view for free I will go back many times and have memorable here but in all honesty I cannot give more than two for the gross gluttony and blandness except for the cliche view which is spectacular of this placeHow can such a beautiful place have such food I lived in a long time and the Oasis was always a must see for my out of town The food s so bad though that I m starting to rethink taking there Hate to say it because I have been a big fan for but c mon Can t you get the food at least up to Chili s quality very low bar by the way To be fair the are good chips and are good and the wait staff hard but order anything beyond what I listed and the quality really goes downhill I hope they turn it around soon With the lake going down the draw of the view is unfortunatelyThis place is great for the It s a very nice place to just chill and relax and get away It definitely a vacation feel Recently they have expanded and new have added on so you have more because the food here room for improvement and sadly it s been that way for It s a bit too They have live music and dancing which is great fun They have a nice gift shop and other that sell jewelry and The other perk you can take the plastic home asAfter a year absence we decided to venture to the oasis for dinner The ambience was lively and welcoming The staff was very friendly and prompt and we were to have a different outcome than before Our were hot but the rice and were with My was rare and the dry with sauce It was slightly better but still unpalatable Find another way to spendView is If you have ever been to a ocean beach area in a hilly area you have seen better The food was blandWe after a family member told us about the restaurant We to be seated We were at a table underneath that dirt would fall off of as people on them The food took a while to get to us was mediocre at best and for what you receive We will not be back The view is beautiful They would get if it was based solely on locationThe good Amazing Great service both times we were here The chips and were excellent The bad Do not waste your time on the The meat was fatty and funny colored had it been good I would have about the portion size but it t No draught And the mixed are super weak Come for the view not the food orThe service was noticeably mediocre and the food had a frozen food and taste to it The music was VERY loud This is a nice place for middle aged people to party and takeTourist trap with mediocre food You come here for the view If you live in you come here with out of town who may or may not realize how bad the food is if they have not eaten else where in Relative to the quality food available in this place really is bad If you try not to compare it to good it is mediocre If you come from some where without you may actually like it View Service is in par with the food My advice Come to see view and just have Go somewhere good for food If you just want to see water and eat go to Hula Hut Much betterI have been here before and after they rebuilt the place You would think after the fire and spending whatever amount on the new building that they would consider a better chef cook but Their food is still bad what your paying for is the view You go to the oasis for bad food slow service and if your lucky a great view With as much money they make they could at least try or make the food edible My two star goes only to their view and not to either food or serviceExcellent view of lake Our visit poorly with a rude waitress and no fan Had to self serve our own after the waitress threw them down on adjacent table and away Thank goodness for our new server He saved the experience t try the food thanks to our lousy waitress but had refreshing and watched the sunset Unfortunately we will not return See yaIn we have a notorious tourist trap the Rock N Roll it s ostensible purpose is to serve the predictably bland fast food that you d expect from s but it s real value in is its size and That s pretty much how I ended up feeling about Oasis From the way this place had been to me I had it to be a charming quaint little place with a nice lake view After into their sprawling parking lot you can get a lift via golf cart if you find the distance from car to restaurant to be too daunting I was quite to find a massive crowded story complex We got a table on one of the uppermost which had a fairly nice unobstructed view but all through our meal we were subject to random wandering about our table from farther back to get a better look at the lake this sort of thing might have been tolerable if not for frequent from a bunch of unsupervised unruly who to have mistaken The Oasis for Chuck E Cheese Service was friendly but very spotty awkward our server was nice as could be but he was often missing for extended And it that no one on staff was terribly interested in dealing with the running amuck around us Food wise we had a bunch of if you are a fan of cheese but otherwise nothing special The were not bad As far as the sunset view goes yeah that s the reason we came out but we left about before sunset as everyone was feeling very chilly as the sun its descent I m sure it would have been beautiful had we stuck aroundDrove here from and this place is a disappointment There is a nice view but the service is super slow Food is nothing special We won t be backThe view of the lake and the sunset are great The were alright the food was alright the service was alright Another reviewer getting and watching the sunset Generally I d agree with that statement The food t nearly as good as the viewOverall the food here is pretty darn horrific been at least a half a dozen times because its yet another one of those that out of just have to go After of trying to get myself out of to yet again out to this place I almost always loose The food as cheap as it should be for the quality The are over priced You re basically just taking one for the team to say you been to the Oasis and to watch the sun set If they didnt have that view I can ASSURE you they would be out of business in a heartbeat I cant believe that there would be anyone in the city who would suggest they go there strictly for the food who being by the Oasis or family of the owner who to live in if I recall correctly for not keeping it local I give it for the food up to a because the view to be a solid Waiting for the next time I have to talk my way out of going there and failing Edit He used to live in in the s apparently and now in Only this cause someone me out of the blue to complain about it Food here stillThe view is great However the food is over priced and it is not very good I would recommend visiting the oasis just to see the viewThe are beautiful but the food is awful over priced tourist food Disappointing I d gone about between and the before and after was stunning to say the least Oasis is taking hold a large retail development Big difference from the last time I was there when it was just the Oasis I don t remember the food being this bad when I was last there but then again I don t remember much from ago Even the are terribly average and the wine selection is poor I think they will continue to pack em in because of the iconic image of the place but like many here have said don t go for the foodEveryone that this place a fantastic view but notoriously horrible food My recent experience is the same as it was ago when I first this place see previous sentence I haven t checked out the two new in the complex but I highly suggest that YOU doOverall my experience at the Oasis was not good This was my first time and we went for a friend s birthday party thinking it would be a cool place to out The service was slow and the food was just oaky and it was What really upset me though was I ordered some extra sauce and the waitress it out to me across the table I out to take it and somehow it all over me This t have been a big deal but the sauce was so hot it burned my hand completely and brought to my The waitress t me the sauce would be so strangely hot or even apologize to me in any way for the I got I had just the about this place and it t live upWe given The Oasis two and were disappointed with both The place is unique and we really walking around looking at the The view was nice even with Lake Travis being low The major problem is the food I can t even say it s so so It s sad that the do nothing about even wanting to change the they have I have read MANY about the food being bad as well I guess because they are so busy on the that s all they care about Well they need to know that people are not flocking there for the food It s the view and If you picked that restaurant up and it some place else it would go under They could have an even bigger gold mine if they edible foodMy were high going in I good about The Oasis however I was very disappointed I feel their are too high considering the quality of food You re certainly not paying for the view the lake gone down so much the view is no longer as majestic as it was in the past I ordered the combination and t even get a full spoonful of rice The hostess real put out when we to move and our waitress was rather curt and not particularly friendly I don t plan to go back because I have better ways to spendI feel bad I never write but this time I had to Ridiculous wait Two and I came to find they never even took my information An hour in I even went to check on the status and the girl barely tried to look and just said well it s only been an hour and it s a hour wait I if they had my number and she just said yes we will call you when your table is ready After and min I went up again and another attendant telling a customer that they would receive a text when they check in I spoke up and told them I had never received a text and had been waiting over It was now Past sunset which was the whole point of going and they hardly now they have seating everywhere so we quickly get seated and finally order Well all this wait for the worst ever Who whole pinto on bean and cheese They were soggy and bland They used the same chips as the chips and they have on the table for an appetizer plate at that Never again Great music and atmosphere but food is and Service was slow All that nonsense just to leave hungry andSuperb specially on when you don t have to fight a thousand people to watch the sun set The food is average but face it you don t eat here for the food Did I mention the supernothing really new here as far as information goes mediocre food trashy cheesy all the are right on However it s hard to beat an ice cold with a salted rim in the late afternoon the sunset My personal belief is that if The Oasis the quality of their chips and people would be much happier with their overall experience at the restaurantThis place one for the view and one for our very nice server Don t come for the food Even the and were terrible It is sad what a tourist trap this place become but we did get a beautiful day and a nice table with an amazing viewIf it t for the view service and coolness of the restaurant I would given only one star The drive up to the restaurant was such a cool sight It s like its hanging off the cliff They have a bunch of cool going on some stuff We sat by a window in time to watch the sun set BEAUTIFUL We were chips and which was good Not homemade chips but good Not sure about the I ordered a which was dry Can t remember the name but it was the one below the cheeseburger It came with crosscut which like it was old stale batch My son got the spicy chicken sandwich which he t finish he said was hard dry and unflavored My son will usually eat and finish most food so I was when he t My wife a salad which she t have because of the romaine lettuce recall dont know why the t substitute with different lettuce oh well She ended up getting shrimp which were My other son had fish which he had to pick at since it was way too spicy He can eat spicy food but this was too much Needless to say we all left disappointed and unsatisfied so we something else on the way home Oh way I felt like the place could be the best if it was on one of them like bar rescue or something They have prime location just better menu and food Thank goodness the waiter was really nice Wish I knew his name The food was way too for the view Read on another review that they we happy with the food hate to have tried it before You can get better food from which I hateYeah save a trip Not with this Restaurant Came here like ago and it was alright not sure what since then but find another place to eat where they actually care about theGreat view good Very mediocre food I give it a C But it s still a good experience if you never been just for a great glimpse of the lake Don t get too excited about eating thoughThis visit was to the rebuilt post burning version of this entertainment It is huge and clearly to some as the place was We at with a largish group and only had to wait an hour for a table I say only because while we the line to get on the list to wait for a take grew to an hour wait Really The sunset was beautiful the food was mediocre the were huge but well and I m glad we did it because I never do it againThe view is about the only good thing about this place Even with a dried up lake We were advised against coming here but we t listen pork was nothing but fat was dry and flavor Presentation in both was depressing Waitress took pork sandwich off the bill with out even they know how bad it isCome here for the view for the sunset and you won t be disappointed If you expect some decent food here you won t be happy The food to get worse every year that I go The location is just amazing Lake Travis but the food the food is terrible and the service even worse It that they know why people come here so they stopped trying It s so sad because I remember few back there were more here Now only Oasis with food Come for the view and leave happyMy family was in town for the so it was a busy time of year Since the family was in town I really to take them somewhere to really blow them away My wife and I decided on the Oasis because Uncle Billy s closed down We arrive and there were nine of us and they said we would e seated in about ten That part came true Ten later we were being to our table But then they forgot about us entirely Our waiter up about twenty later after we had already once He took our drink order and came back twenty later with the wrong It took another ten to get my daughter s temple We went to order our food and it turns out that they are out of on a afternoon at WE finally got our food and it was really on the same level as bar food Definitely not worth the money On a positive note they do have a fantastic view of Travis FieldBefore you go the The Oasis ask yourself one simple question WHY If it s because you have out of town then knock yourself out along with a few big if it s because you want good food don t bother If it s because there is a good band like Alpha Rev go but EAT BEFORE and just drink beer the are way The Oasis is turning into a monstrosity and is oh so touristy with it s new coffee shop and to buy But if you can t get the lake view any other way then I say GO but don t expect anything other than huge parking is a nightmare chaotic service bad food and a very loud speaker system FRIENDLY is a definite bonus though if I do say so and you can wear absolutely anything here a bridal gown or a tank and shortsThis is the perfect to take The view of the lake is amazing but the food is and not great We will come back to have and will always love the viewSecond visit to the Oasis st time t remember the quality of the food We came here today to start our anniversary weekend off The view is simply amazing the were good I got chicken which t great My hubby had the It t the best but it was better than the Next time we visit I will remember not to order the food onlyHigh The Oasis degree of Lake Travis Al fresco food and service eating her with I seriously almost pee d my pants laughing at the look on people s Parking Lots of parking Not So High Oasis Crap food all the drunk leaving the Oasis or on the way to the Oasis from their day of drinking on the lake Even are crazy expensive and they t that fantasticthe view is awesome the food is for what you get its kind of a drive from too i wasnt with the service i probably would not go backThis is so sad to say but the only thing good here is the view which is so unfortunate The restaurant in the best location with a phenomenal view of Lake Travis but the food is terrible I been here about x s now and each time I leave disappointed hungry The food flavor and quality however are decent So if you go it d be best to just have a margarita and watch the sunset Just avoid the foodGreat View Live entertainment upstairs is fun The food however is mediocre Bland flavor average quality Don t expect too much Food frequently comes out cold The view us coming back We do not eat the foodThe Oasis is a mirage in the Hill country The decoration gaudy Somehow the Pollock approach to and only to the shimmer of this false promise The food can be as amateur at best I never been to a which they charge for chips The food variety it is the worst I had in a long time Dirty the plastic had The Oasis could do much better given its locationOf all the I have ever written this one gotten me mixed I want this place to be a Star so much because it O so much potential and because it such amazing lake view awesome sunset well decorated great atmosphere and on and on However I had to downgrade the to a start mainly of the service and food which was not at all good I for such a long time to get seated and it like all the were new on the job the host were new as well It was incredible difficult to get anyone to come to our table and the food took like forever to come out And it took them such a long time to close us out The table next to me we re the same issue of lack of service Management please please you have so much potential I want to come back so please help us help youSo until the day after tomorrow I live down the street from the Oasis and somehow end up here every now and again Each time I tell myself maybe just maybe if I try something else the food won t suck But each time I m amused because Ha the Oasis got some more money out of me But this was the last straw the worst service food and I was just really by the clapping when the sun went down IT s the SUN PEOPLE The sun goes down every day I know it s a rite of passage to go here but just be prepared for a array of food weak and no hot or to check out while you wait for the check to comeAnother example of an Icon ruined Yes the of Lake Travis are nice Yes the Beer is good The food won t kill you The architecture and recently added are atrocious and from the road like the backside of Wally World Just horribleThis is the kind of place where people come for the view so there s no real incentive for good service or excellent food Our server brought us water took our order and never checked back on us until we were finished Actually we had been finished for awhile before he came back He t bring the we ordered as an appetizer and we had no for our Always was conveniently looking the other way when we tried to flag him down Oh well the view was great and the food was acceptable Not a bad lunchThe oasis is definitely NOT somewhere you go for a great meal It s about the experience The view was great and it s a cool local just don t expect much from the food especially for the outrageousBeautiful setting and we were quickly seated but went downhill right away We our drink order and had to wait a while even though the place was relatively quiet Then we our food order And And And We finally down our server and five later our Not only was the food cold but the were as well We how long they d been sitting there in the kitchen waiting to be The only thing which quickly was the delivery with the check We cash to just to quickly leave Our take Got to Oasis for then head elsewhere for foodIt s sad that the of this establishment clearly don t care about the most important thing in the service industry service Imagine what this place could do if they decided to train their staff and actually give great service and make die to come back most being like me thinking wow great view but that just about raw and the lame and the watery It s a great place to out with and the view is amazing but I ordered a that was supposed to be medium and it was seriously raw Raw It s disappointing to see a place that clearly a ton to develop the property and then zero to develop the staffThe two is only for the view Food t good very generic and fare with so many other out there they should really improve their menu but I guess for that view they really don t have to Also it was the little like the food coming out in plastic no dinnerware Probably t come backThe food is horrible and the view is great but t quite make up for the terrible food quality and service by the way If I pay for a meal it had better be edible I d come here for one afternoon after lunch to take in the view only I can t quite figure out why there is such a long wait surely everyone must know by now that the food is But they have up some new and to walk near The Oasis so that s fun to do on a weekend afternoon The last time I went I ordered tortilla soup for an appetizer and a hamburger for my meal As for the soup it came in a really large bowl that the waiter around so much on his trip our table it t even half full The it was practically raw on the inside I don t know how you mess up a hamburger but they sure enough did When the waiter returned with a new over to put in on the grill and cook it I had already filled up on stale chips to tide me over and the little bit of the I ate t that spectacular Again a great place for photo and a scenic view or on a weekend afternoon if you re wanting to pay higher but don t go the food to be anything but abysmalEveryone the food and are My shrimp were bland and had way too many chopped the the any other more the ranch sauce on the Blue Moon beer was really cold as I like it on a warm sunny day We knew we were paying for the view but would it hurt if the food was tasty The next day I pay for a pound of shrimp peeled and by me seasoned perfectly perfectly I will not order the shrimp at the Oasis again Next time we go to the cajun place with no wait It used to be Gumbo s on the lake now it s BonThe food was the view was great but the service was not very good We had a group of and were seated in a table for They told us to pull up extra We were ready to get our at tonight It is currently and we are waiting for the check to be brought back to us Additionally the waitress brought us one check and told us that they never split for large She said she would be more than happy to put certain on certain so we all put our in and circled what we had Simple right Well the waitress took the check then came out of nowhere from the level above and us about how we did it incorrectly Will not be back Edit the check comes back I m sorry if any of the are wrong it was hard to read all the tiny Have a good night One of the with a waitress I ever hadWe went to for a friend s birthday all these birthday She to go here because of the view We for an hour We got free chips and while waiting and drank a little bit But that wait was horrible Now for the food The food was bad that I guarantee would have Jack in the Box or any other The view was nice but to be honest I t come to eat the view I came for the food so that was a disappointment To be honest you would have a better chance getting a grill and making your own on the lake front somewhere It d be so much and better than eating here No offense but the food was disgusting Especially for that long ass waitWith a cold Dos in hand it s hard to fault the view But everything else from the of s food loving and frenetic sunset pic is an exercise in eventual boredom Go once drink in the view and you re doneVisiting from the view is amazing The sunset cannot be beat I never thought I would see so much green and water in However that said the service could definitely be worked on We saw our waiter times Once to say hi and get our drink luckily we ordered food at the same time Next he off our food and together after a short wait Then that was it We literally had to get a manager since we were sitting after we ate our food Wow t come back here Oh yeah the food was nothing notable either sorry The were decent though Recommendation Walk in right at sunset snap a few and walk outSo I been waiting to review this place for a while because I m really at a loss as to what is amiss here I just don t understand it Beautiful view tourist advertising lots of development going up around it and yet there s something just odd I get a weird and I m not sure why anyone else Eh Anyways the food this is a multiple occasion many ordered opinion the view is great We take people who visit us to sit out and chill on the deck The wait staff to be pretty good the menu is REALLY for and the are completely Unfortunately because it is such a great view I go back when people come into town but that s about it I feel that because of that I m supporting a business that really needs to be taught a lesson in listening to their many unsatisfied but oh well Maybe I do Uncle Billy s next time instead If they got their act together meaning their food on par with the class of the building and view this place could be absolutely incredible but for some reason they blatantly just don t seem to care Its sort of sad reallyFor I been trying to rally to go to The Oasis with me as it is a famous attraction and in the I lived in I never been until now The response I always gotten when I extend the invite You be disappointed And I was I reference in almost every critique of a restaurant or bar that I and before As such I m pretty about getting good service Because I was damn good at my job and I know exactly what you should be doing when your e serving me I know when I should have water on my table how often and in what you should be coming back to check on me how long my beverage should take based on the business of your section and the bartender I have high because I did your job before and I did it well and it was a no brainer That being said I did like our server because I felt bad for him He gave very poor service but was clearly inexperienced and honestly did his best to make up for it He forgot to bring us our appetizer completely From the top our experience went like this We were seated on the third level balcony The weather was nice It took to even be by a server and have our drink appetizer order taken In the the came on though the weather t call for it and made it impossible to have a conversation Graciously when we finally did get service he turned them off By the time we finished round one of we were of not being checked on for a second time and still not our On my way to take my daughter to the I brought this up to the waiter who made it clear he had just forgotten He brought us our and another round of immediately which all hit the table at the same time as our Everyone was satisfied with their but me You may think now that it s because I m over bearing and picky but honestly if something cheese on it I rarely complain And it s hard to mess up in general I ordered the Stuffed Avocado pointing to it on the Appetizer portion of the menu when I ordered it The waiter t specify that there is a Stuffed Avocado as well So he made that choice for me and I was brought the option which I definitely t want I could tell he was a hard time so I t complain Until I bit into what was a chilled cold avocado half that was covered with a lukewarm creamy sauce with of raw shrimp and I almost lost my stomach at the table I ate and my chowder Which was alright until I an entire bay leaf out of my mouth For those who don t know these are entirely inedible and must be removed from a dish before serving and made it through the meal quietly The atmosphere here is gorgeous The service is absolutely unacceptable And the food is incredibly sub par It s worth going to the and the neighboring but I d never recommend this beyond the great you can take or adult on the balconyThe good The view is amazing The bad The food the the service Go for the view but don t expect anything elsePretty view paired with worse than bowling alley food I lived in since and finally decided to drive up to The Oasis We had awesome on an upper deck that provided an awesome view In taking a look at the menu you see to like Chips w or No big deal Then you get a small plate of chips with a big bowl of that barely seem fresh and t proportional to the chip offering I let them the pass for this My ordered the person dinner This plate came out on a hot plate that t even sizzling It was as if the server got her late I went with the Trail Price t out of the ordinary Then I took my bite That was probably the most unseasoned patty I ever had If you re going to serve low quality bowling food your should reflect that The only thing saving this place is the viewIts a VERY long ride from and the food just t justify eating it This is something to do ONCE to just go have some and see the sunset but after that it just t worth dealing with the hassle of the mediocre food weak and travel time It certainly promisingly pretty but once you done it there t much reason to go back other than to take other first Basically this place of tourist trap Tip Expect exceedingly SLOW service the majority of the time hereThe two is for the location view and ample parking Food and service was abysmal We got the as an appetizer It was without any chips and we had to remind the staff to bring in the chips tasted old t realize they gave complimentary chips and till we it on other tables and about it We ordered vegetarian and the Both tasted pretty average I got the oasis hurricane which was for We went on a and the wait was about which was considering once can hangout by the and there was a band on the top floorWe went for the th of We over an hour to go in and when we make it in we to please be seated outside they she said I think you are stuck with me unless you want to wait all over again It t what I the food t properly my salmon smelled a lot it t washed right I m not sure the shrimp where just a bit to spicy for me I honestly think is a bit over priced for the basic food they serveThe food is average but that is not that big of a deal in comparison to the horrible service I truly only come here for the view Today was my third time and definitely my last time Our sat on the table for ten before I got up myself to get since we had already our waitress twice for and To add on to our experience there was a hair in my salad Definitely do not recommend if you are looking for a full package experienceThe view and overall atmosphere here is amazing Gorgeous place But the good right there The place is always crowded especially on the it t even matter what time you go but the food comes out relatively quickly considering how crowded it is The food however is very very mediocre It t matter what you order The is at best But I did like the chicken Pair the food up with the well above average and you will be slightly disappointed Also I might be wrong but I don t think they do separate So if you want to pay individually you have to get one bill and tick off the entree you want to pay for Which about an hour when you go with people so that really left a bad impression But the view is gorgeousto go out with a bang on my celebration in so I chose this place as our last place to visit before heading back home to I was so about this restaurant because of the view so I the bad Wrong decision Here s why amazing view Bad service The waiter would forget about us and once we would get a hold of her she d forget what we ordered and her excuse was I have a lot more to get for other people Took us min to get our bill my brother got Food Poisoning off his I will say I my Atlantic Salmon but I feel so bad for him His bill was and now he s spending more money on ER visit and Sick as a dog after leaving that place Waste of what could be an amazing restaurant I will say I voiced my opinion to the manager about the poor service and his solution was to remove the gratuity fee Even though I appreciate the discount I feel bad the waiter had to take the hit She was young and maybe it s a issue then again while trying to take care of the bill there were like hostess standing around I give the restaurant because of the view instead of suingThis place is really only good for the view The food is absolutely disgusting I ordered a thinking that was a safe move WRONG Honestly this was the least flavorful and dry I have ever eaten The also tasted stale SERVICE Our waiter took forever to bring anything to us and really just seem uninterested in anything we said Save yourself some money and just come check out the view and leaveThey do not take it hard for a big group as they are on the number of people in your party being present right there right then The food was sub par The service was good for the big group It was busy and mayhem and chaotic The sunset was very beautiful It is not worth it for the hassle and t drive to get out there unless you like to with big and no I do recommend it at least once You be glad you didI my rating from to and back again twice My conflict the inharmonious nature of this place perfectly Allow me to explain Grab a drink first I have a lot to say about this place My daughter is a new resident of and she to spend her birthday somewhere special interesting unusual The Oasis on Lake Travis is a well known tourist attraction so it fit the bill are so mixed however that before you even arrive you already have a sense of apprehension We told ourselves that we were coming for the view particularly at sunset that everyone about Let s start there Lake Travis is a man made lake by the construction of a dam It is vast and from The Oasis position high up on a cliff you get a very nice panoramic view Yes I said very nice Admittedly it was somewhat cloudy on the day we However the sun did peek out of the just in time for the sunset and it was indeed lovely Yes I said lovely Here s the thing It took me a bit to realize why people were so in awe of the view while our reaction was That s nice There t many of water in central where one can view spectacular from the northeast spending at the shore and all over the world we seen a lot of gorgeous against the backdrop of natural of water So we t quite as The food is the next big topic of debate in The daughter ordered and despite not being a huge fan thoroughly it The husband and I each ordered a different and were quite satisfied as well though the waffle were not even warm Note that everything you order in is spicy They sneak it in there the daughter Indeed are as common as salt so ALWAYS ask how spicy the dish is if hot hot hot t your thing were a tad high for a regular restaurant but not for a touristy spot were very well made not watered down and at for a souvenir hurricane glass sized cocktail without fairly priced Atmosphere You can park within the complex in or in a garage it or the parking lot across the street We chose across the street and it was a quick walk to the entrance As you come upon The Oasis you are taken in by the beauty of the foliage and massiveness of the large stone complex with you to a brewery gift shop At that point the tourist trap reputation is understood We were there on a evening and it t very busy We several outside with empty tables Great No no wait right Nope We still had to wait about Apparently they close off certain on This was strike How can you make people wait to an hour when you have of empty tables Strike came from talking with the Zero social They don t smile and don t make you feel welcome If it t been for the minute drive to get there we might have turned around and out Bad service is another common and deserved complaint about the restaurant But as it is a popular destination I imagine management t really care Strike While you wait at the bar you cannot order anything but No food nothing You have to wait up to an hour and can only drink Strike They text you when your table is ready When we got up to the hostess stand there was a long line of people waiting to put their on the wait list WE HAD TO WAIT IN THIS LINE TO BE SEATED How absurd is that Strike Our table was right in the path of the leading from the inside to the sunset area As people repeatedly by banging into our we t help but wonder what fool decided that was a good place for a table Strike Our server left then t return I had to get up and ask for someone to take our I should have that a manager I assume took over and was very attentive Our waitress did return eventually and The place overall just very poorly run The complex multiple at least dining a stage area brewery and shopping section Sidenote no one was quite sure when the brewery was open where or when the live music was or where some of the on the establishment s wall map were The best way to describe the is frenetic Something to see no matter where you look none of it matching style hanging a giant animated pepper looking hut a monkey on a banana No sense of style or consistency Doing their part to keep weird I supposeNice waitress and a great view at sunset but a truly awful dining experience Set your as low as possible and you may be able to get through itTook over an hour to get food after we sat down We ordered chicken wrap with Three good was good once we got it Service t good either We were very disappointed instead of one because of the view and that sat is were nice and helpful I would recommend going and just looking out and getting a picture but not eating here On top of the bad service and long you pay for it to It s really a shame because there is so much potential here Oh one last thing nope they don t have sweet teaView is great Food Way too expensive for the size quality and flavor Also despite the to the contrary none of the were open eitherOutside of the beautiful view this place is just a bland food hodgepodge garage sale BAR I from a few people how nice this place was The drive up made me think oh yeah it s fancy There was a out front I was convinced this was a super fancy place Once I in I t help but notice all the stuff everywhere it all on our way out to the outside area to enjoy the view while dining and again just a lot of stuff But oh boy we were seated at a lawn table and of the outside is lawn tables and Whatever now I m a Cheesecake Factor type menu but was handed a old laminated sheet I ordered chicken and my date steak My chicken was super dry and everything else on my plate was bland no taste My steak had no juice and when we for steak sauce we were told they don t have it WHAT You serve steak but don t carry steak sauce Was not by Oasis at all Will never go back The are really missing the mark with the gem of a location they haveMy family and I came to for a vacation We could not wait to try the Oasis The view is spectacular However the food was disgusting I the grilled shrimp I don t feel like the shrimp was all the way it flavor and the bed of rice and that came with the meal did not help at all The restaurant could have so much potential if the food was good Two and that s only for the viewPoor We live just down the road from the Oasis but it proven to be nothing more than a tourist trap It s a shame because so many people who live around the area can never go to enjoy it and it s so close The are incredible the set up is just so cool but the high are not worth the poor service or mediocre food We have given this place several but it consistently got worse each time It is always busy and not the Good for people watching though I suppose they will always bring in business seeing as though they target but it s a shame a place like this t better serve their own There s nothing wrong with higher but you d better have the service and food to back it up We don t pay forThe lake is almost full so how can you not pay homage at the iconic Oasis But are still bad plastic after all these Bathroom was fairly hideous as well Go for the view and the must see experience Just beIt only for the view The food was super lackluster Actually it was gross Under seasoned Over fish The service Our experience took about and Not the minute wait before the server came I say come here and get and enjoy the view But pick up a food truck delight on the way home Not worth itBottom line Great view Mediocre food Sub par service We brought some out of town here for the amazing view of Lake Travis Unfortunately that was the only good thing about the experience The food was very basic and nothing to write home about think Cisco The service was worse Our server was very inattentive barely on an extremely hot day She also t let my three year old order a la cart so we for an meal that she hardly touched If I go back it will be for the view and maybe some Those are hard to mess up rightSo like you don t eat here because the food is worth the drive and endless game of parking roulette You eat here because the view and venue is worth the drive So if you plan to here for a night probably enjoy elsewhere and just chill for and get that sunset for the gramIt s a great shame that this restaurant in its excellent location and beautiful view such dissatisfaction with all of customer experience that it its opportunity to become and tourist destination I have been to this restaurant about three times only because of its beautiful view of Lake Travis There are plenty of tables and the know that people want to have a nice view so they don t waste their breath where you want to sit The layout of the outside that this restaurant an effort to provide with a good seat However there must be a lot of going wrong since each single time I have been there I have left with a poor impression overall The customer service is which perhaps I was just unlucky during the day time I went but all I had are very young distracted and inattentive to or complimentary chips The price for the menu are as you would expect from a decent restaurant I just wish the quality of the food that expectation Each single time the lukewarm cold and very soggy were they sitting out for a while before we got them The amount of sweet potato on the plate was obscenely small I cannot recall the rest of the we ordered but I can guarantee that it was discouraging enough that everybody in our table decided to go somewhere else after finishing our meal Each time I returned in a forgiving Trust me I really want to love this place enough to become a regular but I just can t give my business if I am going to leave feeling offIncredibly average food I been going there since the mid s when it was a easy going place for and a cold drink after a day of boating on the lake I m a generation native so I seen this place from the beginning This haberdashery into an art gallery meeting place shopping mall brew pub wedding venue gift shop and tiered restaurant and guess what They still serve watered down mediocre food and poor service We only take there because they of it Go enjoy the sunset it s free for now until they can figure a way to charge you for itI had here a few times and that never especially with the view BUT no matter where within the establishment I order food it s horrible So if you re looking for you re good Eat before you get there y allI agree with many who have already posted We have eaten here twice in the past month The food was poor to mediocre The service was poor and many inexperienced They simply cannot hire enough staff due to the popularity of this restaurant This is a great place to take out of town for a sunset drink We live close by and enjoy the atmosphere but won t be dining here again soonI have been here before with my family and was WAY better service that experience to the time I just came with my It was just very terrible service our server did not pay attention to us at all It was of us and one of our st and we that yet our server did not care When we the manager she did not seem to have any self remorse at all Overall HORRIBLEThis place one of the most beautiful in this area I m new to and I t wait to check it out However the food is way over priced and it s awful If they up the inside and had good food this place would be so It s such a disappointment to go somewhere so beautiful and have some of the worst food that I had in a long time It s as if they don t even care because people still come just for the view Go for the view and and avoid the over priced foodThis place is only and only good for the view of the lake food star food is just not good here service star very poor service view star view is amazing The only reason to visit this establishmentThey are literally only getting two for the scenery and the if it t for that they would be getting zero This food is just downright disgusting Unedible I really don t understand how the rest of my group was able to eat their food The lady that past me on the way in even said this place the worst food in and she was totally right But like I said the scenery and are amazing so if they could just get a brand new chef or maybe just change their menu they could get higher But now I will have to go get a fast food meal on my way home tonight because I t eat anythingNice view bad food In the of Gump That s all I have to say about thatI use to this place every time I would visit it was a must But now the menu is horrible I hate that they took the spicy off the menu I literally got up and left when they told me they were no longer making them It s disappointing when there is something all of my group of want to go get and cannot You basically pay for the view Maybe they will decide to bring them back and our group can start going backService tonight was awful Food are very limited and the quality is very below par Clearly this location is living off of the view There s such a great opportunity to have a high quality restaurant here but currently it is significantly below par A standard tip for a large party clearly affected our service Don t come here for the food or serviceSuch a shame that a beautiful location like this mediocre food with horrible service HORRIBLE My and I in and right by a hostess since she t to us We ask to be seated at the second counter and they tell us we have to check in with the hostess Ay ya We were told it was a min wait so we head to the bar and take the chance to wait since it was a beautiful day and we drove just to enjoy the location We ordered but that never came and was supposedly going to be sent to our table but it never came The upside is we only and not don t know where that disconnect came from the only good part of the experience Was seated and t on until about at the table thank goodness we still had our My had to pull someone aside to help us Eventually when our food came and we never saw our waiter again The was nice but it like they did not have the staff to support the He was a bus boy and a waiter which is so ridiculous Then I staff out loud about the amount of I worked for and the last thing you do is complain out loud do they think we cant hear them Whats the deal These should be counting their lucky business is good and the fact that they receive You would be seriously in my The owner needs to improve staff and add more staff on the Maybe not high school would be a great start Oh right the food Don t go for the foodI was hesitant coming due to and past a few back But the majority won Well my gut was right Long wait not great service high not the best food Basically for my ticket of And more than half the food left on the Party of and Sat at The hostess took us party of to a small top with We stood inside a few then she led us outside to a table in the cool wind We inside due to But by this time we were just ready to order The chips and and were good The cold wind was not good and the t working over out table Let s just say I do not see myself coming back againYou go to this restaurant for the beautiful view and the great If you want to actually eat something there s a gas station a few down the road that some and candy That s your best bet as far as eating something good Don t expect good food here I went super simple after reading other Yelp thanks and got the hamburger even that The quality of the meat was poor Also there are some stank ass here They re like dumb and rude My cousin the hostess if we could charge his phone and she to help us out like that me off Great place to go if you re not hungry and don t care about serviceWow interesting but way too touristy for our This is a huge and impressive property This place is more than a restaurant there are also and a brewery of interesting They also have decorative attached to the outdoor and that I found pretty interesting Never knew there were so many different We only had as we really t find anything on the menu that to us We both had the Perfect It is a frozen drink although it is not on the menu They were in a large glass and were pretty tasty Great of Lake TravisTwo for awesome view next time just Food was terrible awful mostly Not even choice for a good piece of steak The whole place is showing age not too clean kind of chaoticI love the set up of this place and all the They did a great job after the fire Also this is one of the best for scenery both nature and eye candy Today I in and had fresh for an appetizer and the grilled with asparagus and red chile rice The had WAY too much salt The asparagus was pretty good not over The rice was tasty and the fish was a little over Overall not bad but I t go out of my way for it As for the service the manager who was very nice Nick more attention to my table than did my waitress The waitress off friendly and good but when the food came took a break or something Our ran out and we never did get on the water Hell we t even When the waitress did come back I my opinion about the food and she tell the cook not to put salt in the at least not that much She really t care I mean you could just tell by the way she at me She just and said I let them know I screwed up I should told Nick I go back just because I like it out there and you never know what eye candy is walk by Just one more note For the price they need to pick up on the service Maybe my waitress was a bad day or something But for a bill and I t get ice water have your bad day another timeThe Oasis on Lake Travis what it does right and what it could work on but it sticks to those two and will likely never take initiative And heck I could care less They offer a great view of event and atrociously mediocre food If it t broke don t fix it People keep coming back so keep the way they are Oasis You will find all Oasis attractive for some odd reason the gaudy the enormous dining area and the open ended menu I have no idea why I even afford it the benefit of a doubt but I do The for and comes out lukewarm somewhat clumpy and just plain bland Moving onto the end of the menu the run roughly a head yet the enormous of meat boast no flavor and rubbery texture sitting atop rather unremarkable and Specifically my shrimp tasted of fishy character Alas you come for the atmosphere Not much more needs to be said The kitchen fully how they fall short of quality but they will likely never take corrective And I could care less I only come once in a blue moon as itYou are really only coming here for the view and it is beautiful However the food is absolutely terrible as everyone else will tell you and the service is really bad as well I was told not to order a complicated drink as it would be an issue for the staff by my friend and she was right I ordered a vodka soda took about min for my three to get their and mine still not in sight This was in the day was not very busy yet either Finally ten min after that I got a water and had to correct the server and order my drink again I finally got it about min later all my were on their second drink by the time I got my first Next she forgot two that my ordered and just kept one drink at a time Total nightmareUGH you hope after not going there for a few that either the food or the would get better t happen I went there on a night with of my gal Parking EASY and free ya for that then we are going down hill so hold onto your hat They have two standing outside to take your name for a table the Starlite had just and they are pushing you to go upstairs to the lounge I said I need a table for Well lady it will be a hour wait for that thinking Seriously so they take your number and you when your hour table is ready so off we went to the Starlite which was just open so lots of tables We order our and before the even I get a text that the table is ready yep and I am not even going to go into the headache to get the tab on those in plastic We did go back down to get our table yes working the desk inside and EMPTY TABLES EVERYWHERE and your I wont even spend the it will take me to share with you the rest of the night Easy parking great view and STILL service andGreat view food and awful service We have been here times and never left satisfied First of all the waiter forgot that we ordered so after waiting or so he if we any After we ordered again another waiter brought them to the table beside ours After roughly our waiter told us about the mix up and said were coming right out Yes he did bring the and but we had been sitting and waiting so long that our st basket of chips was empty He went to get more more waiting Finally and this is the BIGGEST reason that I will not go back I have a child with special needs and they were NOT accommodating Great is the best I can sayOnly get for view and some nice wait staff Poorly run Crazy with of tables open and not being used Spring Break is not the time to understaff Almost now and still no foodThe Oasis is basically just Chili s with a nice viewIt s cute Love the atmosphere and the view The food and Not so much I been more than a few times for and every time I m like me sad because this place under the right could be a killerI love coming to Oasis for the view Somehow we would always sit at the Oasis brewing company and never really went into Oasis restaurant Today we were in a mood for a early evening I was here with my little daughter We had a nice spot outside and our server was wonderful He was always paying attention After my daughter was feeling very cold so we the server to see if he could move us to a place where there was heater He said the waiting staff would come and help us out We for and then the waiting staff came out with a pretty fowl attitude We were smiling all throughout dint quite understand why she She us to grab our food and she would show us the table I found that really weird I dint quite understand why would she or some one else would not help us with moving the food and to our new table Any ways we took all the stuff and her where is she seating us She then said we would need to wait again and she would go and check in the front This is bizarre why would you make us pick all the stuff and make us wait at the entrance to the patio when you haven t yet figured out the table After waiting for I made my way inside to find her She saw me and me to follow her to the table This was inside and at some corner We were fine since my daughter was warmer We dint have any water on the table The new server assigned to our table barely checked on us We got done quickly and in cash cause we dint want to keep waiting for the Credit card receipt I went and spoke to the manager and let her know about this she acknowledged it and thats that This place you feel like you really want to enjoy this but some waiting people carry a bad attitude around I have no idea why would you behave like this when we have been so nice The management should definitely look into this I will appreciate it if they do cause this is very disrespectful We are coming here to have a nice time and spend money on food and It is not worth any of this if the service is bad I am still with a slow service but being disrespectful and not giving a damn about people sitting there is not niceThe view is beautiful and the alcohol does its job Our server was great The food I got the don t eat the bun if you re That was the most overtly friendly thing on the menu that was a good source of protein It was gnarly I will gladly drink here but I t recommend coming too hungryOrdered fish got a whole baked piece in a tortilla with purple cabbage horrible I m not sure what spice they put in their rosemary Ugh terrible The had a lot of sour cream First and last time for this place Nice viewIf the service got better I d give it a star b c the food was delicious But wait staff do not make for a good experience Won t go into the but when I can t find my wait staff person for then YOU HAVE A PROBLEM which my problem Great food amazing view beautiful venue Get some decent staff and you have the perfect composition for a star restaurant Keep the same work staff and do no training you be mediocre at best Sorry to be so blunt but your potential is exponential don t screw this up your wait staff are the of your organization and they are the reason for theGo for the stay for the sunset and DO NOT eat the food I can t say I was not thank you yelp The setting and restaurant are absolutely gorgeous There are a ton of different to choose from to soak in the sun The and were happy bright and well Tip bring your camera for amazing for fun with your and familyI had this place for about more than a year It was one of many I to go when and if I visit To my surprise my aunt had chose this place to eat for her birthday It was a hot and humid day like any other day but still we chose to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful view the restaurant had to offer Looking at the menu I was kind of whether a plate would be worth it or not considering how high priced they were for no thank you My aunt ended up a variety of food such as and for all of us to try since we were taking awhile To our disappointment when the food came most of the were very Such as the whether the plate was too big that it made the food portion look small or the portion was actually that small With such small not even the flavor could make up for it for it was not even all that great I ended up sticking with the chips and and had a bite of the dessert they brought out for my aunt Besides the view the food is not good enough to be The service was good even while they were training our server it still went well Our were never empty and she was very friendly and attentiveI m not sure where to start The horrible service upon arrival or the sub par food Let s start with the hostess station There were yes FOUR behind the counter you would think that maybe one of them was friendly nope all disrespectful Strike We accepted the fact that there would be a wait at on a and into one bar only to be turned away and told to go to the other Strike Finally got a text that our table was ready and then told to go to the end of the line to wait for the table we d already for Strike We were seated ordered food and were within a reasonable amount of time BUT the were cold cheese unmelted and the chicken was not chicken rather small that were cold Why two The Bloody Mary was delicious but certainly not that good to salvage a disappointing and epic fail in the customer service and hospitality department We won t ever go backFood is bordering inedible but the and view make it a trip If they can sort out their food quality this place could be special But maybe they don t need toThe view is SPECTACULAR The food is The are weak I payed for two and two The food and were probably a good worth so I for the viewonly because of the View Food was horrible Service not much better Was here ago was good Man how this place gone downhill Food wise Oh Over priceTook over an hour to get food after we sat down We ordered chicken wrap with The food was good once we got it Service t good either We were very disappointed instead of one because of the view and that sat is were nice and helpful I would recommend going and just looking out and getting a picture but not eating here On top of the bad service and long you pay for it to It s really a shame because there is so much potential here Oh one last thing nope they don t have sweet teaMy rating system is a possible star for food service and other Food No star Blah bar food star Full bar Service No star Pay to order spot Long long and slow service star Gorgeous Excellent spot to watch the sunset but eat before going and maybe even game and have a cocktail before getting there Other No star No hostess It s first come first serve seating which there s no chance of getting a table especially if there s more than two of you I would never go back Too crowded stressful and inconvenientAfter of coming here I should give up on thinking the food will get better The fabulous view is the only thing that us coming back and it is nice to have a full lake to look at Wife ordered chicken lettuce and got some strange combination of chopped dry chicken and lettuce leaves that were hardly large enough to fold over much less hold any meat Don t mistake these for anything you ordered at an restaurant For the second time in as many I ordered as they frequently do a decent job and they taste pretty good For some odd reason the last two times I ordered them the only vegetable on the hot skillet was not a bell pepper in sight I tried shrimp for the first time and they were pretty bland so I would stay with either chicken or beef and save the extra money My son his fried chicken sandwich and I guess I stick with and from now on The are average and expensive They ran out of syrup in the Sprite up fountain and ruined my son s and my second drink My replacement drink was so sweet I t finish it like there should be technology to prevent this from happening with today s technology Our server was friendly and fairly attentive so all was not lost They move massive amount of people through the place on a nice weekend We had an hour wait a few past and were seated just before the sunset me a bit of being in with the line of off people If you wait until after sunset you can probably walk straight in and get a nice tableService is little poor They all say like they smile a all good once you start if the are not expensive you can tell how the service going down Food is just whatever nothing you can t taste at any cheap restaurant Why is this place si popular Cause of the view to the lake That is super good This is the type of one time restaurant and that s it I was really a better experience here Did I mention the men s is only for one person Yes it is I have to add By the time we I gave the checkbook to the waitress and when she I tipped her attitude completelylike such a waste The Oasis such a cool setup with amazing but it s wasted on a terrible restaurant Every time I have from out of town I think to myself gosh I wish the Oasis had better food It would be the perfect spot to impress my and family with the beauty that to offer However I would never put them through the agony of a meal that airport food feel like fine dining I wish someone would save this gem and turn it into an awesome or something Agree that it s great for the like all of my fellow have stated but I d be hard not to drive there get out of my car look at the view for a bit and get right back in my car and drive away It d probably be a more enjoyable experienceGo here for the not the food We had a group and our were up flour for someone allergic who for corn My steak and shrimp were huge but the steak was too salty Eh not worth the minute wait probablyI gave it a second star only because the sol margarita was pretty good The rest was disappointing for such an amazing spot with a great view The were not just dull they life The food was pretty bad and for such quality I ordered the chicken lettuce and the chicken was so dry I it altogether This place can be so much better in this spot with just a bit more effortWell the Oasis is weird and you can clearly tell way too much money been spent trying to turn this restaurant into village or something Aside for the the food is pretty boring The place is huge and I never seen more than handful of people eating here at once I got the fish and they were bland and well just bad Don t eat here if you can avoid it My margarita was very tasty I suppose if you end up here with a group of people you could just drink and look at the gaudyLet me start off by saying the and atmosphere are great The food however are completely horrible It s all made in some factory somewhere the chicken even he FAKE grill Horrible foodNice view not much else Poor service and incredibly average food type dish was made with frozen whole small shrimp and was fairly nasty was average not so great tasted like dog food and everything is Go for the view and don t expect much and you won t be disappointedThe Oasis is such a touristy spot that it its appeal for a lot of If you re looking for a spot to have pretty good bar food a decent cocktail and a spectacular view of Lake Travis this is the spot Because it s so big the service is almost always substandard in my opinion which is why it only Regardless everyone should check it out at least once to form their own and like I said the view is awesomeThe view is the service was the food was star at best The grilled chicken in our was completely over and so dry it was hard to chew The orange chiffon stuff that come with it was completely inedibleHave to agree with L Our waitress was disappointing She had a flat affect and when I to her about their I if she could tell the bartender to add a little more lime juice because I don t like sweet she said no Said Our are and we don t do that I was so turned off It set the tone for our whole experience Our were terrible I ended up a beer since I figured they t mess that up Food was mediocre The restaurant itself is beautiful but when you have service like that it ruined theYes the view is unmatched in Going there on a night it s hard to come up with anything else positive to say about the place Oh yeah they picked the best band in town to play there the Brew First you should be aware of the new layout The first two were uncrowded and reasonably pleasant You can sit outside or inside with the A separate entrance to the third floor It s a large open bar where the band was The dance floor was and the setup is terrible There was only a narrow path which is also the bar area to walk through from the front entrance to the entire rest of the third floor The music is great and there is a beginner class The good generally won t go there though I m not one of them A dance floor with like me is actually the reason the good don t go there I would recommend work boots and shin if you re going to dance People like me will be constantly bumping into you and stepping on your A lot of there were dressed to impress but I don t know how they with open toed The food been at best average for The service is still consistently terrible Out of six people the waiter completely forgot to place the order for one of the six No manager came to apologize nothing but an from the waiter We forever for him to appear and another eternity for the food and then one of our simply never came Beyond that they only give you chips and if you request it They don t ask if you want any While waiting for the first sign of our waiter one woman in our group over to the bar to get some water The bartender said flat out No and that she had to get it from her waiterSome helpful for your inevitably Star experience Ask for some ranch along with your chips and The for is enough to feed maybe even disappointed people Get some relief from the heat by wandering around the air conditioned gift shopThis is my first time at the Oasis Restaurant The view is beautiful The food not so much we ordered the shrimp it was so bland my ordered the and t even finish it Not worth the wait unless you are there just for the viewI to ago In that time The Oasis reverse from a local diamond into a lump of coal Yes the view is great The view is the only reason this place t just one star If you re content to have a terrible experience and food simply because you enjoy a great view then The Oasis is your place But you can have nearly as good of a view from other on Lake Travis without such a touristy and experience Whether it is the multiple story parking garage or the giant gift shop or the tables or the general haphazard manner in which everything is laid out you re bound to feel like a number and not a person I doubt the owner two about my review And I feel no ill will towards the man He a cash cow and he s content to milk it until it dry According to a news article he is building and a hotel next to the restaurant He s got to turn The Oasis into an attraction and a master community If that t scare you off as a tourist I m not sure what else will This place all the touristy feel of Fisherman s Wharf without any of the charm If you t from please do yourself a favor don t come here Spend your precious time in any number of our other equally beautiful and much more interesting and local If you re from go ahead and try this place on a weekday just to confirm what I already told youOasis is way out the way from everything right off of Lake Travis which a nice view if you can get seated near the view Upon walking in you will have to provide your number to be notified when your table is ready unless your seating at the bar It was quite crowded but the wait was maybe only I was seated on the lower level close to the lake which was nice but it was HOT A nice fan would been nice versus sweating to death The waitress service was nice except for one incident I had briefly got up to socialize with a group of ladies before coming back to my table during that time the waitress went to the manager stated I had out When I came back to the table I had to ask another waiter to find my waitress so I could check out When she came back she said she thought I had left her manager stated she was in trouble I informed her I was merely away talking not sure how she would assume I but the manager was more than welcome to come speak to me The manager t speak to me but the waitress did bring my ticket to cash out I then left Oasis Sunset not sure why there is a drink limit per guest when the drink tasted like juice Well drink Tequila Cranberry Juice it was just right Food I ate everything except the pretty much Everything tasted good but t something worth coming back for Would I come back No the overall experience just t what I It may be a popular spot for people visiting but I t recommend itThis place is really really weird It s a small shopping complex out in the middle of nowhere It like it used to have a lot of but everything out besides a brewery a boot shop a record store a ladies and they have a wine tasting room but they told us they were leaving too They seriously had maybe vacant ghost town The view of lake travis is great but not sure if it s worth the drive from anywhere of noteI was so excited for this place and it was just way lower than my The only good thing about Oasis is the view It s gorgeous And there are other you can walk to and have a view as well We around on a and the wait was about even though the restaurant was not full and we over to the ice cream spot and there was an area on the side of the restaurant that you can view everything It was gorgeous So the restaurant we were seated and I saw two tables along the railing across from us that had a direct view so I ask if I can be seated there when it was off One table ONLY had two on them The answer was no and that I d have to be put back on the if I that table The table was maybe away from us so of course I m staring at the tables once they are off and other people are seated there after about It was so off Something so simple as good customer service The menu is very basic we ordered and the shrimp I do not like so I about in the dish and was told there was none My rice had in it so I only ate the shrimp which was actually good The my friend barely touched The lady who our food off literally our food on the table such an odd experience She came and it down and mot even in front of us My food was just put way on the other table down and she away Our waitress I believe was nice but everything else besides the view was just plain bad Might as well go to another area in the complex and view the sunset and eat somewhere else or come fullThe scenery here the drive worth it The food well the scenery here the drive worth it The Beef and Chicken Combination were very flavorful but the beef was hit with way too much salt It like the meat was turning in to mush in our due to all that salt The saving grace was the Sol Margarita This was the only margarita on the menu not made from a mix we were told and it tasted like it It had just the right mix of pucker and sweet without the and Take a tour of the inside while you are here it s full ofHonestly I m really disappointed The Oasis is such an Relic and as someone who grown up here but never been until tonight I was more I admit that the and were outstanding I imagine that if you a great spot to bring a date for this would be perfect If you felt like sticking around for the food though find somewhere else Everything we ate was totally bland and unremarkable I had the cheese and my fiance had the chicken The had hardly any sauce It was basically like warm cheese The were equally unsatisfying with a severe lack of any real flavor In addition to the low quality food I was disappointed with our He came by to take our drink and was very stale I feel like I get more charisma at a drive through window than I got from this guy He came back later to take our just as blandly as could be then left We t see him again until the check He never once our even though they were both empty before our and I honestly wonder what he was doing all that time because the restaurant was not busyI decided it s an immutable law that every place with a beautiful view to have terrible food There s no way around it You can t have everything people The Lord a beautiful setting and humanity away by a restaurant on top of itGo to Oasis for the pristine view of Lake Travis go to enjoy the delightful sunset but don t go their for the food or The food is mediocre at the best And the mixed are extremely watered down Yes they are busy and will continue to be busy until someone else comes up with a cool place to see the sunset Otherwise I recommend spending your hard somewhere else Show up an hour before sunset to get a good table to view the sunsetWas very excited to celebrate my birthday here but was incredibly disappointed The view was beautiful but that t make up for the extremely poor service t checked on once and food Will definitely not beBest view food and worst service inThe are amazing but the food is crap and over priced I d rather go up to the brewery where the food taste better and isThe view is the only thing that was amazing here Service was terrible The host was great but our server took forever to get to us and it t even busy When we for some chips n since we been here before she said no because it s not complimentary She then took our order which was their oasis she t ask how we them driest like they were sitting in the heat We t even finish them Good thing the view is amazing but probably won t visit again Disappointed to have this type of service in these timesThe view is great and they do serve a beer well but it s just sad that the food is mediocre and the service is slow even after waiting forever to be seated in a half empty restaurant The golf cart drive worse than New York cab and he to us about the people b us not tippingThis was one of our first in the area and we were looking forward to some great food and a gorgeous view I give you one guess which one of the above the Oasis actually on Some local of a member of our group and us to dinner here so I was really at how mediocre to bad they food actually was I ordered the spicy beef I m a sucker for food and they were definitely spicy but overall they could have been a frozen dinner you could buy at the grocery store The chips were likely from a bag and the was bland and watery I some with a friend and it was but not great and the color tortilla chips it came with were stale and gross I had three and they had little to no alcohol in them usually hit me kind of hard and at each that s a huge problem The service was Not bad not stellar but I can t really complain The worst part is I for myself to eat a disappointing dinner and drink some weak and look at a nice view I definitely feelThe only reason people come here is for the view Even though you have to wait at least a hour for outside seating The food is blah Nothing special Definitely not worth the minute driveThe food was and the view was spectacular not from where we were seated though They put us under a set of rusty with a partially view of the lake When people would stomp up and down the it was pretty loud and I found out after finishing my meal that rust was breaking off of the and falling on my plate DONT come hungry You will not be happy We were told min hour to get a table and it was almost exactly I can t be mad about that but the it took to get our food AFTER we ordered was not acceptable This place was not worth the inflatedThe view alone was plus for sure This is a must see view of lake Travis Service was slow and inattentive We only had a Hurricane cocktail you keep the glass and a beer Hurricane was you choose the drink that is mixed or frozen It was fair and not a traditional hurricane Go for the viewThe only reason they received two is for the view The food is so so and you might as well be drinking if you order a margarita But you have good sceneryMy came to visit from so I thought this would be a perfect place to go so they could see the sunset on the lake It was beautiful as always but our waiter Mark was too busy helping out a table that got there after us and t even on the They were first and he barely attention to us We received our chips and AFTER our food came out and I t get a side of ranch that I for until after I finished my food If there is a next time were going for the view and eating somewhere else s possibly at the brewery which is much betterBeautiful view pretty bad food and You know the story What do I have to offer in addition If you fin yourself at The Oasis don t order the You get a plate of Yuck Not beautifully marinated and grilled you get other like s El Rancho Find something elseWell the can t cook here food is decent and one heck of a viewIf you want a nice view and some this is a good spot for that If you re looking for good food look somewhere else Nothing we ordered tasted good which just made the final tab even more painful to swallowWe just had The chicken was very good but the tuna salad was poor For the amount of people in the restaurant you would think they could hire an excellent chefThis place is Stunning from the outside and the patio is just gorgeous with that view Unfortunately that s all you will get from it My husband and I travel a ton and we ordered thinking there is no way that could taste bad mind you It came out not sizzling so you know it was all separately I never tasted such bad steak and shrimp in my life The shrimp was so over spiced that it felt like it was that way to hide the dryness and freezer taste of it The steak was just awful you could tell it t fresh and was mushy The were so bad we never took more then bite and sent it back the taste with cheese and sour cream just t hide it well enough for us to continue eating We left and headed to the domain to eat This place is good for sunset and a drinkThe only reason I gave this a star rather than a was because of the view Thank you beautiful Lake Travis It s a little weird of a setup inside and it is a hit and miss whether the band is good or bad but will most likely be when you are there Really the only place you want to sit is on the balcony as that is what you are there for the view Food I honestly t recommend eating here I have eaten here twice and both times are honestly really bad The quality is just super lower and I have come to the conclusion that this is not going to change because they know they have a great location with an amazing view Of course you cannot go wrong with a bottled beer since they can t screw that up But food wine are all really poor quality I cannot recommend this place unfortunately because of the food If you want the view go up the extra to the brewery with a better view and better foodI love going out to eat and enjoy dining at both low end and high end I have been to The Oasis during the day and I really it but recently I went for dinner and it was huge difference It was a two hour wait no as it was extremely crowded unfortunately no one was social in any way We decided to go the bar to wait In one night we out waiter forgetting out drink then blamed us by saying she t find us we never left our spot we a huge fight where a young woman phone over the balcony and while we left a lady screaming and around I think with Covid and the not being open no one really any where to go so unfortunately The Oasis all the interesting people I still like the food so Ill try going here again next year and during the dayare amazing food is bad and service is slow Pretty much it up Come for at sunset and then go get dinner somewhere elseProbably the best part of Oasis is its location and the wonderful view I think all that is good about the place there No one us as we and we to one of the tables by the lake A waitress turned up after and told us that it was a table for while we were just so we would have to move to another spot I t really find any justification since only about a quarter of the tables were full and it could hardly make a difference If they have such seating then they should seat when they enter The were just about average and the service slow I will probably be back here only for the viewlovely location and view dirty and dirty Wait staff was our server was decent but halt the staff were standing around drink with visiting them Meanwhile the place was plain dirty I am afraid to think about wha the kitchen may have like Food was mediocre and not worth the price Not a genuine experience Atmosphere was carnival likeI have to reluctantly review one of my favorite on the lower side of Avoid the food if you can The mediocrity of their and the they re sold at easily off three HOWEVER COME HERE FOR THE VIEW This spot an amazing vista of Lake Travis Time your visit for a sunset treat as well as after it to see the lake in it s all shining glory This spot a perfect spot to take a date to your s first time seeing Lake Travis or if you just want to think and don t mind the slightly long hill country drive here then be my guestThe sunset view is great but that is about it The food is mediocre The service is not very consistent The last time I went out of the kitchen up of them The my cousin ordered was a complete waste of money When it came down to paying the check we found out that they will not split the check you have to add up everything yourself and tell them what card to use We at first thought the waiter was being lazy He had been the entire time but after another waiter we found out it was policy I don t think I will be going back the sunset t worth itI came here yesterday with my friend The place is beautiful and the wait time to be seated was reasonable around However the food on the other hand was mediocre at best First of all I was going to get a but they said I could not get my patty well done What in the world I thought customer service was supposed to be a top priority how hard can it be to leave the patty on the grill for a few more When I why they t do it well done I the most ridiculous response the don t speak very well only I told them I was fluent in and I could write it down for them but they still said no At this point I to get up and leave because this had become ridiculous I decided to stay and get green chicken and the and rice were terrible The only good thing about this place was the view and the That s the only reason why I am giving it It s and not worth it at all I get why the are the way they are but you think for those the food quality would be great Never coming back againWe never mind waiting for an hour or two for great food and spectacular we had at the bar and finally received our text message that our table was ready the food and service were a major let down the shrimp was very very dried out and the sirloin had no taste I ordered the and there was very little meat on the bone this is a place for and beautiful place to visitThe food here is horrible You only come for the experience not the food You would think a nice and popular place like this one would have flour made by hand instead they are cold Store bought The service is but far from being good Then on top of being disappointed I come back to my hotel and are sick all night because of the food definitely ruined my weekendHonestly they need new staff the two hostess are very unprofessional and where talking about who to speak to the manager the first waitress we had told us people who ACTUALLY got to get a seat by the railing when we for over an hour The second waiter was extremely nice The hamburger So over all nice view food and don t listen to the hostess make a reservationThis is one of my favorite to eat in and this experience was not pleasant We for a table for two We never got the text that our table was ready Our food came out less than warm They also had a limited menu due to COVID I m very disappointedI guess you don t need good food with a view like this Wife and I went here tonight Service was actually good for a place of such size We had chips and good bad lemonade bad iced tea very bad tasted like it was out of a summer camp or school cafeteria bad bad badI live literally down the street from them and have been here a dozen or more times and even worked here The food is dinner quality Over the it just getting worse and worse The view is the only thing thats worth a darn and the Thats IF you get a good table I recommend getting and a drink and thats itThe best thing about this place is the atmosphere The food was mediocre the service was terrible We had an added gratuity to our our server did not deserve it We t get chips were sitting with empty for awhile I only give it for the view other than that it would be Do not recommendTwo only because the seating area and ambience are ideal to enjoy the sunset The host and staff cater to this strength the most with first come first serve seating for balcony seating Interior is cozy and warm as well with a fireplace The food not They give chips and to begin the meal The chips tasted like chips and same for the Albeit we only tried the chicken and The for being non native was alright with good mix of for the kick The is it could do with more and salt The chicken fireball was to be really good but it really just tasted like freezer bought buffalo chicken that was probably in house It was with ranch that was good But then again how can ranch not taste good I would hope the taste better Overall I think food is overly priced and does not deserve any mention whatsoever The place nice and great ambience Would recommend coming to the area for but eating elsewhere rather than wasting money hereThis might be one of the most in Amazing Corny as all hell Serene location Crazy running around everywhere Beautiful nature Atrocious man made You get the point Come here every once as a tourist and hit up Vice cream to keep spending reasonable But otherwise go to a parkView is beautiful but would not recommend the food very and not good food t even look Would definitely recommend just drinking here but eating elsewhereThis is time we this place Food is so so no feature Price does not match to the food quality The only thing good is the view I will not come back againThe view is the only thing worth coming here for Service food and were awful It took before we were Our waitress just assumed we would have our entire order ready when she finally but we were a group of and as well as adult She that we were making her come back The menu is tiny and very unappealing but I found something that good it probably would have been good if it t room temperature I it away and t eat more than My husband ordered and the same for him cold and went uneaten Nothing was said about our full and the waitress just brought us a check Again the view of the lake was the only reason to go But it s not worth it if you waste your money on bad food and worse serviceThe here are SPECTACULAR but in my opinion that s all you re really paying for I came here on a beautiful day and was seated outside My date and I were sitting there for a long time and other tables that were seated after us had already been We had to go see what was up and they actually to have forgotten about us As we our server we a couple request to be seated at a different table The host told them that he would ask but the answer is probably no About five later we saw another couple get to that table so it that the host just t feel like doing extra work Now onto the food It was very and mediocre This was already because I know this place is known for the and not the food however the service was inexcusableWas not Food is entirely too expensive for the quality Same goes for the The view is just the sun setting over the lake Big deal go to hula hut and watch the same thing for better food and much better Put it this way I had one mixed and my husband had a beer and a salad with no protein seriously lettuce and tomato and we spent like I was still hungry and the serviceHorrible service I will not be back First the wait was terrible Then the table was dirty and not down Then we had to wait another min for our food only to be told they forgot our orderGood luck finding parking here You need all the luck in the world to get good food here The only quality of this giant restaurant is the gorgeous view you get of Lake Travis and of the sunset I went with a group of recently for a double date The alcoholic drink was but expensive The food was a nope for me because everything just tasted so bland and heavy You also need to wait a long time for you to see your waitress again after the first time No given that this place is by for all three inside and outside this restaurant The second time I came to the Oasis was for a wedding rehearsal dinner You d think that a wedding rehearsal dinner would have quality food Nope Unfortunately the Oasis can t even make good You d be better off going to s They are have better food and are s is closer to wherever you stayThe only saving grace of this place is the view Food and way and service is horrible and slowI haven t been to Oasis since the original burned down a few ago so I was to see what s become of this place Oasis become a monster tourist trap The view of the sand of Lake Travis was pretty and sad but Oasis is now a giant ode to gaudy Oh my goodness what How on earth did the of this property convince the bank to finance their colossal cowboy mall The food just as I it from a few ago Nothing is good here except their lemonade I ordered the candied pecan salad with grilled chicken The salad part was but the chicken was way and dry had the and I was he finished them It was bland and bland Boy can eat anything What more is the dozen or so vacant lots of this outdoor tourist trap Oasis built a huge ostentatious restaurant with too many and their surrounding vacant lots are a testament to a bad real estate plan Our server was helpful attentive and prompt Most of the here like high school but they were fine I d come back only if someone else to see the view but not for any other reasonPretty sure people only come here for the and not the food I m also pretty sure the restaurant t care about the food or they would of it I won t say I never go back It s not horrible but always remember to keep the bar lowFrom my you can easily figure out that the view and location is amazing and there is no doubt to that Problem comes when you see the food and service Pathetic is the only word that can describe it The chips and were I order and it was may be one of the worst I had and then I to ranch side which never came The serve game so much attitude when I for it as if I was for her liver I was just for got dam ranch not your liver Also they do not sever beer for the brewery next door so big yeah for the good neighbor Will never go backPro you can see the sunset without to eat at the restaurant are good but needs another shot of alcohol in it food was decent but not bad Con wait time could be from an hour to hour half if you are coming to watch the sunset Expect to arrive early as possible make sure you t seating near the i provided a pic where i was seated at There were so many people coming and taking right before the sun was setting Mind you there was a group of who were done eating prior to us that was seating behind us but had a higher view came down and took a long time taking in front of us right before the sun was setting and when i kindly them to scoot over we had the sunset We over an hour to be seated to see the view for it to be blocked by people I think the management should set a rule for guest to not obstruct any during the last of the sunset We were not happy that we had to wait for our table with a view for this long for it to be the wait for food was like an hour The waitress told us that they only have kitchen serving food for i did not see a distance of a table for social All tables were full and not far from each otherGreat view very food that is super expensive We about to even get in and after that were put in a super dark table were very polite though If you really want to try prepare yourself for disappointmentThey had a live band that was amazing and it was so fun We had terrible service We for a table They took us to our table and it was not We had to wait hour to get a waiter Our beef came out red and uncooked This was a real disappointment Don t waste your time or money Go for a sunset and drink then leaveThis place an amazing view but that s it I for a cheese it was burned I t even for a temperature That s take it or leave it lazy cooking The food here is a joke the are criminal ButView and atmosphere Amazing Food It s sub Chili s quality but priced like a It s one thing to overcharge for your food because your restaurant a great atmosphere like Joe T s in Worth but the food here is actually quite bad in addition to being so expensive This place is worth going to at least once but stick to something basic like which to be the thing on the menu if memoryWorst experience ever The hostess sat us but t offer any water or anything We sat for a good min Our server us three times and I even made eye contact with him but still t come to our table When everyone else got their food he decided to come to our table an hour later to ask us what we would like to drink Wow We ordered and another for it to come out Mind you we came on a th March and it s not busy at all So all in all we sat there trying to enjoy the view food and for three from start to finish I but nothing came out of it We were in tableOh what can I say about this place that t already been said The cheesy bronze Sexy Native woman in a statue sent up immediate red as racist are apt to do to when I see them The first time I was here I had recently turned and it left a bad taste in my mouth and I have yet to have a positive experience here but of course every time someone comes in from out of town they insist on coming here The thing I had to a positive experience was getting by instead of outright at by the staff This place a great view like everybody but coupled with the horrible service and Bland like licking the back of the freezer food it s a truly experience Every time I go to The Oasis I find myself What the hell just when I leave You feel invisible and also incredibly conspicuous and it s just such a strange thing to experience and definitely not in a good wayView Food quality Service for quality of food and service View is amazing just know that is what you are paying for going in and you will have a good timeThe view was nice and service was friendly but the food was way less than great In fact I had way better at most hole in the wall I ordered fish which were pretty sad and chips and with my lunch companion Nothing to write home about Great view but the food not so muchWhat you really pay for is the view which is amazing but it t worth my most recent visit There was an appetizer we ordered but never got so we ended up taking it off of the order at the end my came out with not one not two but extremely long together on top of my sour cream and it concerned me that my waiter t see it before giving it to me The only thing I was satisfied with was the turnaround time on my new plate of food and the margarita I had The staff was friendly and you can tell that they were trying but it t hard enough for me I haven t had service as bad as that in a really long time As an native I always going to the Oasis but I m not sure I ever go backI would have thought with Covid may have settled down minute line to get to the hour wait Everyone the food and t great but the view is awesome We t waiting It s not worth it Will pass for another couplestar Star food Want to watch the sunset Order then leave My best advicehour wait Which is understandable for a popular restaurant by the lake on a evening We decided not to wait but just enjoy the scenery up on the third level You could see the whole restaurant and saw that tables dirty for close to min because were to lazy to cleanOur waiter took to even greet us The menu t have a wide selection and everything is Not to mention that parking is a nightmare The only thing that s good about this place is the view of the lakeFor nearly my family the Oasis on more or less a weekly basis during the summertime It s tradition splash on the bug spray and head over to the Starlite t to watch the sunset and dancing listen to a great band and have beer and So what if you have a hard time finding parking and you get and dust in your flip as you re to the place cannot describe our disappointment at our first and probably last visit since the renovation is complete No more Starlite Terrace That was the best part I gone inside the restaurant exactly twice in We it when it was first come first serve seating on the terrace You could just get a drink and stand around enjoying the until a table Last year someone had the bright idea to have wait in the hot sun to be seated not very cool but we put up with it To give you an idea of how much the the Starlite Terrace one summer evening it pouring down for at least NOBODY left So now the dancing is on the floor in a too small too dark setting with only about tables that allow you to hear the music AND enjoy the view We were led to our table on one of the through a maze of and too close tables The view was good But by the time you put up with slow wait staff barely passable food and and a trek to your table that is likely to leave you out of breath somehow the view t enough Staff told us that the Starlite Terrace was going to be turned into retail space SAY IT T SONever again We went the other night when our family was in town We got there about and the wait was not that bad at all The issue the table four our party of eight was dirty when they sat us down There was food still on the table on the and wet under all the place Not cool The food its still the same belowThis is one my favorite to go to enjoy the of Lake Travis Unfortunately the food and the service here is lackluster On my last visit in I came with a few to celebrate my th birthday Although we were not a large party we did order many off the menu The menu were not brought out as a whole order rather a few at a time which left many of the party with cold food Generally when coming here I do not come for the food but for the beautiful View Food Service',\n",
       " 3.0: 'My family and I decided to have a late lunch at this wonderful spot on Lake Travis The of the Lake are great but the food is just average for food in It was tasty enough but nothing special Most of my party had their fish The pineapple in the was good but the and was just average I had the beef They had a little kick in the taste which I did like but otherwise they were unremarkable Our waiter was trying to be helpful but was slow to refill the and restock the chips and also average but not stale There can be a bit of a wait to get in but they are pretty efficient at getting you in queue so your party can wait in the bar explore the gift shop or explore other like the brewhouse or coffee shop I think is is pretty easy to get lost so keep your party together and your phone on so you will get notified when it your time to get seated are moderateEh but ya be there at just the right time or be very very young Which we t Food was nothing better than you d get at Service very friendly fair Now to the reason for the if it s just and or been it s humid here We went in late June normally very nice but the humidity at Lake Travis was abysmal Had to sit inside and well boring It s and experience but only forWhen you type in to do in in of The Oasis will always pop up Before coming here I was told by many people to not expect good food I guess people come for the and the So my review is based just on that we did not order any food The Oasis is about a minute drive outside of downtown We came during which was on the top tier They had a live band music that had lots of people dancing During we were able to get a table pretty easily I ordered a couple of and they were pretty decent The only downside was the top floor we were on was not completely covered and on a degree day there was barely any so it got really hot especially more so with a hundred people dancing I would definitely recommend better air I d love to come back here because the of the sunset over Lake Travis were definitely amazingThe wait t terrible only or so We sat inside and was after about and chips came after that Once we ordered our food took forever we were informed the kitchen was behind We never got on or Chips until we were able to flag anyone down our server was hard to find The food was great I got chicken and my got chicken both were tasty but for the price I tGreat view and atmosphere at sunset Food is not great but of your more into the lake and entertaining people then it s a good placeFood is so so Service is so so But who goes here for that It s the view silly The are always good usually of the party band variety Family friendly but and dad can get a drink too Yes it is now an official tourist trap Sunset is spectacular but you know that Plenty of parking and valet if you wantEven though there was a mix up with our dinner the restaurant was clean a beautiful lake The food was well prepared but did not have much flavor and a little cold I assume this is a restaurant for and not really on food or service but I hope we just came on a rough dayIt lost all its charm when it burned down and was rebuilt Food t get any better but their are really good Service is still bad and twice we out because nobody ever on us after we were seatedI don t typically write simply because I hate a complainer but this is something that it had to be said The view is amazing trust me but the food was a bit over priced for some I t come here again maybe for a drink or two but nothing more I work in the restaurant industry so trust me when I say I m being easy on this The host where not necessary rude but not welcoming they said table for how many and that s all the walk to our table was simply silent our waiter was really nice but she t very attentive she had a good attitude unlike the host but she did lack consistency The food was pretty dry and not what we So if your looking to pay for a plate of and a scoop of rice following with an amazing view and rude hostess here is the placeOasis me of a or something similar on the City or beach which I found odd Complete with a lake view seating for your and a souvenir shop the place was only The food was borderline chain restaurant but t bad I t go back because I m a tourist to but don t really regret the decision Probably great forI t been back to the Oasis since the big fire in I had some out of town this past weekend who to have lunch Lake Travis If you haven t been back to the Oasis since it was rebuilt you are in for a BIG shock They went all out with their remodel and must have been inspired by a combination of and The new Oasis is over and over the top to put it nicely On the plus side there were no interrupting our meal to take After read previous I had really low about the food But I m happy to say that the food those low It s certainly nothing to write home about and it s not even memorable but it s a reasonably priced meal with a pretty view I miss the days when the Oasis of lots of cheap patio furniture and a phenomenal view It as though the Oasis is trying to upstage the grand view that in so many people It still be a place I bring out of too but no longer a place we head to for a drink on Lake TravisLike everyone come here for the view because the wait and the food you can get anywhere else I the place a little better back in the old days when it was just a restaurant but now the place grown into a little tourist city and not very appealing on the But everyone an opinion on taste in and this one I can do without It kind of the hill country environment if you ask me The do not go here unless the in or the corporate management is in townTaking the average of my two at Oasis The first time our server was really great the family thought the food was pretty good and we sat outside with a nice view This was for lunch Yesterday we drove back again for dinner It was the wait was an hour which was fine we t call ahead We caught the sunset after walking around the entire building Eventually my family of four was seated at an eight person table in a cavernous event hall It was like huddling in a dark corner of an unused warehouse There was poor lighting and we t face each other We to be seated at a four person table and they us to a high bar table with impossibly low We left because no one had us warmly there was no view inside or outside and the did not reflect the experience we were getting As we left we saw another couple complain about poor service and leave tooAll for the Simply the best in The food is worse thanThe food is mediocre but the view is excellent hence my three star rating I had a fish for lunch and a chicken fire ball as an appetizer one star rating to both item for tasteIt s all about the outdoor and cold adult here The food is sub par tip stick with the most basic and the service while upbeat between non existent and forgetful Still for a cold rita or beer while enjoying sunset splendor this place is hard to beatWe came here for and on a cool sunny day This place to have and of front row balcony on tiered I have never seen a restaurant maximize their biggest selling feature the view of Lake Travis as much as the Oasis Which is actually brilliant because this is the main reason why people come here and they won t be disappointed The waitress was perfect service was quick sky was blue and the view expansive They had of on outside so could feel comfortable sitting outside when cool You should come here if you want to outside have a bite and a drink with a great view of Lake Travis On the highest level there was a brewery pub with live music guy with acoustic guitar music and a fire pit outside Cool place to hangout for sureTheir view Food and service neutral Nothing crazy I wish they had a better menuI was in for the day and just had to come try this place where the sunset every day around We had stopped by before heading back to because it was to me by a friend Even though it take about or more to get a table if you want to sit outside it be worth it when you watch the sunset The service was decent other than waiting about an hour and a half to get a table However they were frequently on us The menu were decent too I decided to order the fish which were in corn with and other I the shrimp but the were a little hard I did enjoy the rice and that came with it There s the good old chips and meal The is cold but it had a nice little kick to it I believe this should be featured more around the menu Other than that the food could been done better but this is a great place off of Lake Travis to have a nice end to the day I will certainly tell everyone to try this place even though it s a little drive away from the city You can self park or valet park However it s a little hard getting back here since it s through the If you want to come out to enjoy a beautiful sunset come out to one of the most popular inLet s be honest the only reason to come to the Oasis is because of the The food is seriously mediocre and the are a littleFood was just Wish the would focus better on customer service a little harder and the food menu But overall not terribleAlways love the Oasis Not so much this time We at the Oasis at and we re told there was a minute wait To make the most out of our wait we went upstairs to a local brewery that Fantastic and all split a flight of beer which at At we were also by the Oasis saying are table was ready What min wait is cut down to min We told the Oasis to give our table up to the next in line so we could drink the beer we just They said we would have to come now or we would not be seated b c restaurant closed at I them why they told us min wait at if restaurant closed at In hindsight there were plenty of tables available at the min wait response I believe was to discourage us from coming since they closed at We had to throw out our flight of beer and rush downstairs We ordered worth of food and drink at the Oasis and I the Oasis Manager Bill to simply make us whole on the upstairs beer transaction which he to do Although he us I found this gesture inadequate They also t sure if they could get us extra or since the kitchen was therefore I would recommend not coming to this restaurant later than on a Our waitress was very nice and the food was decentBased on food quality value and service alone I would give it The star is because this place always me well when someone is in from out of town that just to see a different side of the city think old people and you haven t seen in that come from rural of or They just don t know any better on the food front and when they see the view and begin ing and ing you file this place in your bag of cheap too Well maybe not so cheap And if you need something palatable on the menu try the they re actually pretty decent When the meal is over take the old down to the gift shop and buy them some gift shaped like or some sort of ridiculous jam or fruity with a brand name like Big sIncredible and well worth the drive Grab a drink or two bring your camera and snap away I to rate this place higher but the food is completely we had a large group and nothing was exciting the food was devoid of any spice Great and the t bad The view alone the Oasis worthy of a visitare great date was great Not to about the food or the On multiple the food and are different the consistency t there It s a great family restaurant but it s all the location really I was super man about the s not a table and that was very uncomfortable for s who want to stay a while and have a great time I sometimes feel it s so big that the service t as great or t more personalThe view is really nice However the food is below average It s nothing special and of their t that great The me of something I would see on kitchen It s both old and full of garage sale looking and stale and a little dirtySuch a shame that a restaurant with a GORGEOUS view of Lake Travis have such food Came during lunch on a afternoon and there was only a minute wait I ordered the perfect margarita and it was indeed that A basic margarita but with a little orange juice added there was a slight sweetness that I We ordered the and it was alright It up pretty quick me of ordered the redfish and I just ordered the bowl of tortilla soup The soup was quite nice I the His redfish was not bad as well It came with rice and I like the plastic souvenir Grab a refill before you walk out The service was great Our waiter checked on us often I think food wise the Oasis should consider the menu t really seem to fit here They have the potential to be more upscale A or place would seem like a better fitI had read a bunch of on this place being a tourist trap mediocre food and poor service All those are kind of true but I think if you re coming here to enjoy the sunset and grab a couple of then it s worth it It s an amazing view of Lake Travis and the sunset is beautiful We went on a evening and arrive at and were told it would be a hour wait This honestly t surprise us seeing how large the place was and how the place was We two watched the sunset in the patio for waiting and left to eat at s Still worth it in my opinion just to see the sunset and view I can t speak for the food but it t look that bad from seeing what ordered just expect like s or Chili s level quality maybe lesserCome here for the view The location is pretty amazing and the building itself is absolutely massive The food is average and beware the overly sweet The service was great however and it like a neat place for This is a fun place to grab a drink and show visiting from out of townThis place is an tradition that I have been to many times The view is spectacular Most tables are set on that are several hundred off the water The sunset from the is incredible It s a great place to meet with and take great with the lake and sunset at the right time for the background The parking is terrible with new additional and next door Large will wait for some time to be seated The food is expensive and not of the highest quality The are great You are really paying for the atmosphere It s almost always in the summer often with live music on the stage on the floor People dressed up and ready to have a good time This is a place you go to for a unique experience of People new to town will gawk at the view and be glad to see it It s a place to go relax drink have a great time and eat if you don t have from the food Worth at least once and for the occasional date night other than a big chain restaurantI order the Chicken and the Beef Perfect place for dinner with a view of Lake TravisAnyone will tell you this place an amazing view But sadly that s about it Their food is pretty below average t very good and their service always been very bad Even when they t busy the service is super slow I m convinced this place only stays open because of the view and it s cute style It is a tourist trap also so beware onThis place is really all about the view because the food is very disappointing you would expect more from a place with such big I would not consider this foodBring a coat in case there is a hour wait it can get pretty chilly after the sun The food is but the scenery made up for it all My wife an I will definitely be back but just for on the balconyI want my Mommy Imagine if you dare the following Classic and not so Classic Rustic Western Pier my aunt s Bay City guest room furniture white wicker Oriental Still art Office kitchen chic Urban wall Big Lots Grease Gone With The Wind Back to the Future Godfather movie Extraterrestrial and s all and into a frenzied salad that came back out of the oblivion from whence it was That is the impression poor C and I experienced the night we decided to size up their Starlight Lounge ing one bizarre night Nothing in our previous could have prepared us for that tapestry of I don t know what The Brew band itself was alright a medley of mostly from s with an occasional cha classic We did notice however that a majority of the clientele on the were tipsy fresh from the free in the evening so there is no need to feel like your stepping style is being maybe we will judge you but we re not there anyway The area by clearing tables near the stage was nowhere near large enough to support the number of people dancing It s hard to whisk your lady in a suave manner when you re surrounded by all up in your In summary View is supreme But we all knew that theme is unfathomable The st rule to Oasis is you do NOT describe Oasis The rule to Oasis is you do NOT DESCRIBE OASIS No free water at This is unacceptable inconceivable to If I boiled flavored larvae I d come here Not even insect candy Extra star for making us ponder then over analyze shell shocking would be the operative wordIn for the weekend and the took me here to watch the sunset over Lake Although it s incredibly touristy and cheesy the sunset and the company were divine Go early to get a table outside at the upstairs bar The are pretty good don t order foodI came to this restaurant on th after a few of my and I came to for zip lining The view is gorgeous The service was great However the food was mediocre If you re coming for the ambience this is a great restaurant If you re coming for the food I would suggest making another choiceCome for the Come for the and Skip the food This place is really cool but the restaurant got to hire Top Chef s to get me to leave a better review Used to be an must visit staple Now it to be a must visit tourist trap I hope it better somedayIn a nutshell Host staff Our with the teenage hostess squad were not pleasant Rude condescending young ladies Our pager went off they us to step off to the side and subsequently forgot about us until I said something ten later Service Crummy Hard to get drink Our server lost interest in us after she we t going to order food I a man seated at a nearby table to a manager that his waitress was being too with trying to get him to order more stuff he was dining solo Pet peeve Menu We t eat so I can t comment on the quality of the food but if the chips and were any indication I t expect much We only had beer so cannot comment on the quality of mixed Drink did seem to be mostly reasonable for a tourist trap locale I give them that Had a nice variety of and other The view Amazing as and the only reason you would ever want to come here Three for the view alone Get here at least an hour and a half before sunset They have a TON of seating but not enough As a result they will start on a wait list despite the fact that there are a ton of empty tables to be hadBest part was the view Service was not great Very slow even on a winter week day Food was good but nothing to rave about Enjoy the view have a margarita and just don t expect anything else to be exceptionalA local food factory Billed as the outdoor restaurant in It s big As it turns out my meal a streak salad and a peach cocktail was actually pretty tasty even though my were low Chips and were fresh Service was considering the size of the operation like atmosphereMy Experience at the Oasis A great view and amazing weather with awesome cinnamon ice cream Delicious margarita that left me a bit wobbly walking to the car I had a great time at this place The dessert was worth eating even if you think you can t possibly eat another biteGreat view service and strong but the food The quantity is good but the quality is not that great unfortunately I recommend going here for the and some to go along with your but not for any mealGreat and scenery however the food was nothing to rave about We ordered chicken and shrimp The chicken were dry with not much flavor and the shrimp was not what we shrimpThe one thing I will say about this place is that the view and is the best of this place Each room inside a different theme and feel with large that over look Travis Lake My family been coming here since I to and have it The food is pretty good but the quality is just par I would agree with most of the here It is just one of those that the food is not so top notch but the and atmosphere is what people coming back Their waiting area yes it that a bar and stage for and a dance floor From here you move toward your table and depending on the weather you could get a great table outside If you do the view is just great There are have been many times where we have sat outside and the weather was perfect The menu is just one page broken into three of of The are mostly above and can go higher then or more The fish and steak are the higher priced If you plan on visiting this place try to go when it is not a busy time night or and try it out when you can actually walk around and see the different The staff here is also nice but mostly of college type The surrounding environment is just great for taking with family The gift shop is a fun place to visit so be sure to set some time for that If you go plan ahead so you have time and try to get a table outside with a great view and if they move you to a table not as close just ask and they will be happy to help at least they did for when I wentThe food is but very expensive you t technically paying for the view But the lake is really stunning I wish they can make the food better since the price is on the high side The wait is too long as which is annoyingBeautiful location The restaurant on a hill top above Lake Travis It cuisine The fish and shrimp are a favorite of mines The restaurant three and an incredible view of a sunset The third floor a dance floor and a stage for to play On the there is always live music It s an Bucket list must do and it s a great one to check offI been to the oasis twice the main attraction is the beautiful view The staff always been pretty kind and accommodating it s a spot that to always be busy The food is I m not that picky with my food but food quality here is just The are pretty good and the menu variety but I t say it s better than any chain restaurantThe view Five The food one or two at best The are average and a little If you have never been out to the oasis you need to go out for a drink and watch the sunset The view itself is worth the tripUpon my return visit after I break the review into two FOR If you have never been to before you should definitely come here From boots to candy local craft beer to this is your spot Imagine a four story mall next to a three story parking garage with a beautiful lake view Expect the food to be new and different to you but not true FOR If you have a memory of the traditional Oasis do not come here now It completely itself It is terrific for but little is left of what you remember Certainly the sunset is absolutely gorgeous But your sacrifice of wading through with and four and a three story parking garage and a mall effect will make you say you wish you were back in the old locationI wish you could separate Food and Location on Yelp Food would get a and the View a The food is edible but not far beyond that It just for barely However the Very Good I read before I went about them being over staffed however that t seem to be the case when I went with a group on a evening They were definitely busy but very attentive So I d recommend and the sunset and eating somewhere else if you re looking for good foodThis was my first time in and my were very intent on taking me here because it s a pretty popular place It s BEAUTIFUL I t get to look around the whole restaurant but the front of the restaurant is just beautiful with all the stone work and then inside its like a majestic house with some carefully and style carpeting It three I believe and we were on the second level and got a great view of the lake It s stunning Come here around so you can watch the sunset over the lake gorgeous The food is the menu is mostly mixed with I got the cheese which were bland and with too much cheese I know how can there be too much cheese The service was good our waitress was friendly and sweet The drink menu is mainly beer but I ordered a gin and tonic and it was a little sweet The place is super crowded so call ahead I don t think I d come back even if I lived here It was a nice experience but a one time thingLove the sunset go down here love chilling out here with good as well nothing to say more but the place is spectacularView was great Even for that only its worth to stop by You get free tortilla chips and which is good I had and the portion was way to much for one person tasted good not the worst I had not the best eitherAs much as I like to take digs at this place I really do like certain of The Oasis First off the view is wonderful especially when the lake is not low The can really be amazing and this viewpoint can really capture it all I would definitely recommend sitting out on one of their many people don t go there to sit inside and enjoy the sunset with one of their extremely unimpressive Avoid the especially the chips and should you choose to have them remember me telling you I told you so The food t as bad as they used to be they have certainly come a long way but they also have a ways to go before I spend money to eat here again Given that it is a hike away from central I do appreciate the atmosphere and all the surrounding that they have put up in the area so that you can enjoy more than just the view when you have to drive to get there If you are a music fan they do have a small but great open air music venue on the top floor which they use periodically to host live music so check their calendar on the The Oasis is always on my list of to do when we are entertaining out ofI love the location of the Oasis but the food is just blah It was worth the drive for the view alone If you feel like you want to just look out at the lake and out goThe Oasis is the kind of place that you go to for the view not the food The evening I went the sky was truly gorgeous with a hundred colors scattered across the horizon as the sunset over the lake Make sure to book a reservation especially if you want premium outdoor seating As for my meal it was I ordered the chicken with rice and I definitely had better For the quality and quantity the are Of course it s the view that you re really paying for and that up for the lack of gourmet food In short if you want a delicious meal there are a hundred better in If you want to enjoy a meal with a view the Oasis is your placeFood was alright and it is a bit If it was phenomenal i would be paying that much but i guess you re also paying for the place view Atmosphere is great since if next to the lakeWant to see a stunning view Oasis is the place The scenery is If you re an out of towner this is the spot to absorb the beauty of Lake Travis I went couple ago for the first time in and major have been made Its like a fortress castle there Oasis you fancy huh At sunset they ring a bell I thought that was pretty cool since everyone is anxiously counting down for the bell and on they have night great way to show your dancing or to learn if you have two left Service and the food are not the best my s cooking is betterGood view of the lake Front porch some good for photo I like the shuttle from the parking lot The service is a little rough and sloppy But the lake view is great Sunset must be beautifulHubby that we drive out here I was that it was so far away but the drive ended up being pretty beautiful They sat us on the first level many up from the railing I was with it but hubby thought we could do better A friendly server that we could ask the for something closer or we could head upstairs for seat yourself we would likely find a rail spot with the best in the house We for upstairs that was a fantastic move Server was pretty quick were decently priced strong delicious We t try the food because of the fabulous here because we t really get the incredible food from the menu The view was just amazing somehow we just to be seated right before the rest of the tables filled up just before sunset GorgeousFor an dollar Margarita I d expect it to be much more instead you get about a My wife had the with chicken and beef both were so dry I thought it was jerky I had the southwestern lettuce and surprisingly it was a very flavor balanced dish Overall I gave because the food was edible and service was good And if you ask if I d come here again Maybe notGreat view Good but slow service Average food My chicken sandwich had a strange almost crunchy textureEat somewhere else then come enjoy the view and some tasty but sorry nothing on tap The is awesome in the greatfirst first the view is amazing here Definitely a hot spot if you want to catch the sunset on the lake but beware of this place because it ridiculously We had about an hour wait and we were seated on the patio The service here was pretty good to what all the other said As for the food we ordered the It was good Probably will visit again but just for and the view thoughHad the fried shrimp It was pretty good not a very large portion but that t a bad thing Nice environment overall and the view was wonderful The service was pretty fast as well I did notice that there t many that were friendlyMy first trip to in This place is a MUST STOP and see The VIEW is AWESOME The food is just go there for a spectacular SunsetVegetarian are limited but they do have a but it s not that good the house salad is normal Next time I would just skip dinner and just get and dessert and enjoy the view Service was fine and the balloon woman who came around was super sweet But I think because of the eclectic atmosphere that it a lot of more like a tacky theme park than anything else Which is fun but my group t prepared for that type of experience if we were we probably would have had more fun View is amazingIt s fine My their chicken and we our chips and I t mind drinking my margarita swirl while the lake too much either It was a great stop after the water I don t think anyone goes here for the food so we knew what we were getting into It s but you re really paying for the location and it s a pretty rad one It was a bit odd that there were a lot of empty along one side but I that they expanded a bit too optimisticallyThe environment and the are amazing the neon with seating took the cake since it s so out of place next to the beautiful terrace I went to night great place to bring some and dance The view at sunset live band t ask for more except some decent food Ordered the steak salad the I think Took us over half an hour to flag down a server even longer to get the food and when I took my first bite it was in between lukewarm cold and really dry for a medium steak The salad was something I d except from s not for And s me hot food So lesson learned I eat elsewhere before coming to danceThe View is worth seeing But the Service is Not good The food isThis is in line with the rest of the I read KILLER view sub par food Most of the in the Oasis area were also closed while we were there unfortunatelyFood was horrible view was nice Meat taste horrible nothing was good really besides the if you go just get save your moneyYou have to understand that going to the Oasis is like going to Twin you are paying the view Thus the food is sub par and you better bring a road flare if you want to have any hope of a server refill your drink of take your order As long as you understand that going in you will do fine If you can get away with just doing DO IT Seek your food somewhere really anywhere elseI had a great waiter here He was friendly prompt and t forget anything The food however could have been so much better The rice was basically tasteless which was really surprising considering all the that appear to be in it The were very runny It like bean soup The shrimp came with a really nice dressing They were made with flour which was but I think it would have been better with corn The view was of course amazing We sat inside but went outside after we ate I would suggest going at a non peak time We went before noon on a somewhat rainy day so we did not have to wait for seating or make I may go back some day to try it for dinner see how that to lunchYour defiantly paying for the view as gorgeous as it is and fun as it is to go to all the and drink overly priced alcoholic The food is just plain awful I suggest eating before you go and just back with some chips and and some Live music is always nice tooReally great location Food was good but not great Our server was good and attentive My only complaint is that when the hostess tried to seat us in the bar we politely said we were willing to wait for a table in the main dining area she then tried to seat us on the aisle in a large and empty room We ourselves to a better table out of the walkway I do not see why will try to that when a room is emptyI lived in for six and had never been to the Oasis What a sunset I been missing The view is glorious and when with a margarita in hand and a one by your side it becomes the perfect way to bid to daylight Lovely That said I will reiterate what everyone else already covered the food t great I had chicken and the rice was hard and and the were lukewarm Yet would I go here again Absolutely So for the view but for the food I suggest the dinner and just a drink to greet the twilight Oh and also the wait was about on a warm and breezy afternoon early evening Not a problem Grab a drink upstairs and people watch or let your hair down and dance to the sweet of the Brewshort and sweet and to the point VIEW Best I have seen of Travis Sunset was beautiful ATMOSPHERE Great the wide open space and the balcony Also that there was a huge stage with live music The band was even good BUT music was loud Could not hear anyone at my table throughout our whole meal Add on was strange and like a ghost town SERVICE not lie as in all it Waitress took her time never got my drink refill i extra tortilla s I ordered FOOD So we ordered two of to split the big fit for two people There was four of us and there was of food The chicken one were great t really a fan of the rice and though t try the steak i was told by my mother that the steak was dry ALL IN ALL I would return on a not so busy night and get another mango because that was pretty damn goodEveryone goes there for the view Is quite unfortunate for whatever they closed the lower on the We were seated on the upper level and it was so cramped Our server is very inattentive We additional to share our food and it was never brought to us We a server and nothing was done Only on our request before we get our The food is but I suspect most come for the view The interior was nice very chic Too many and One can easily get lost insideBasically you come here for the view and pay for food I ordered the chicken and for extra and that s for enough for people and my friend ordered the spicy chicken sandwich that comes with a side of Out of the two the chicken and and the side of were the only that were close to being The chicken for the was dry and I had to add from the chips that were given to add flavor to it We had to ask for extra ranch for the chicken sandwich since it was dry Service is always different every time I come with It s either acceptable or just too slow In sum I would only come here with family or for their first time to see the view of lake Travis but I t come back for a return trip for the foodThe view is great and our waitress was very attentive even though she had a ankle The food was uneventful we had the for It was a nice portion but tastelessthe food was pretty good my sister and I had a great time then the worker at the front desk was so rude so I wrote a comment card she saw me write it after being so rude to us then once we out the door she took it out of the comment box then I the manager and he was rude as well not willing to do anything about her I everything else but theI had the for an appetizer and they were pretty good Service was above average but my main meal was shrimp which was at best average Overall this on food but on the view Had a nice evening hereI should put out this disclaimer that I t eat a single thing in this restaurant We came solely for the sunset and man it t disappoint The food SMELLED amazing sure but my friend assured me that we d be better off going somewhere else So we did I will say that the drive was brutal and we were basically racing the sunset But in the end it was worth it And we ended up eating at a much better placeTwo star food but the view it up to three The food here from to typical bar food However it s not great by any It s not bad either but certainly does not live up to the that the name On very hot days despite the view and the mist the outdoor seating is unbearably hot Perhaps go here once for the experience but there are far better in and aroundI love the view of the lake and the sunset But the food really t that great The are pretty decent and so is the wait staffThe food really t that exciting I had it about a month ago also many times in college You don t go here for the food You go here for the most beautiful of Lake Travis the are pretty decent tooHonestly I give the location five but our waiter less than three The view is awesome but the server was less than impressive The food was decent but let s be honest you go to The Oasis for the experience and the We had an enjoyable time and I would probably go back again We were told by a shop owner to go to the Pub instead because the food is better We were going to but we already had a table at The OasisMy honey and I went to grab dinner at the Oasis for our anniversary weekend getaway in Our experience was food but not great First thing I will tell you is arrive at a decent time or expect to wait up to an hour or longer What caught my eye was how huge this restaurant was There s even and a beer distillery near the restaurant The place like a mansion with multiple I think my favorite part of going to the Oasis was the view Not only the beautiful view of the lake which we t get to see since it got dark when we got there but the inside of the establishment The was very vibrant and colorful The bar area was fun and You can out there while you wait for your text confirmation to come through The are delicious but definitely tourist priced The good thing is that you get to keep your drink glass as a souvenir for a couple of the that cost about The chips and are decent The we got were pretty delicious I got fish but I my sauce for ranch which was tasty My beau got the sour cream which he and We were both huge of the rice which was very well seasoned and soft The were not very enjoyable They flavor big time I wish the service was a little better in of wait time but we were patient with our waitress because we knew she had plenty of tables to attend to We would definitely come back to try this spot again but at an time and maybe not at a busy peak of there s such thingThis place be best view of Travis Lake We went early for lunch but I imagine the must be amazing there The service was quick friendly and accurate Everyone else their food but the chicken on the I ordered had an odd rubbery texture Everyone their mixed and our server was funny and friendly I did tell him about the chicken and he said yeah I probably should something else that t really make a customer feel good about their experience but I agree he should have I will without question return to this place to catch a sunset and grab with family andAstonishing with or without the high lake Always better when the lake t bone dry Food however is beyond poor quality The food is less than and it s extremely for what it is The wait is always outrageous on gorgeous nights Sunset is the only time to go Be prepared for outrageous parking at that time and come early to get a seat if you d like to eat The view is the only thing worth going to Definitely take out of here once to experience the beauty of Come on a full stomach or just for semi acceptable are worth it most of the time Grab a drink and enjoy the amazing sunsetFood was decent but a bit The shrimp were about a the soup was an My friend ordered the and said it was really good The on the patio at sunset are aI always good about this place and everyone I know those plastic with the Oasis on it After of living in I finally checked it out Definitely had great of the lake and the service was good We t have a problem with parking but I think that s because we went in the early afternoon so there t much of a crowd I ordered the shrimp with almond crust and mango chutney While it tasted fine it was pretty The on the other hand were wonderful Well made with the option to add a tequila floater Which I did Twice It was a happy night Even though it s quite far from the city the drive there great scenery and it s nice to get out of the city sometimes Unfortunately I left my credit card on the table and got to experience the long drive again the next morningI m going straight up the middle on this this is based mostly on my most recent experience and the oasis can be very first get some out of the way location yes they have the best location for taking in a sunset over lake travis this is the reason to come to the oasis and the reason why of other people will be there it s not the food factory this place is now run like a factory you line up to get a pager pager goes off and you step up to a big hostess control center the head hostess several and s of tables come up and she them to the constant stream of turning flashing red a constant stream of minor walk the to the table number assigned by the master hostess like a never ending assembly line factory food they have a lot of tables and they turned them over pretty quickly too the kitchen does a good job with consistency the food t great but it t bad don t go for the food but I can t complain about it they came quick and the perfect margarita is pretty good or good enough service our server was great she was always around drink were taken quick food check the food was by a runner working the food assembly line the food to the table number he was to just like the hostess I find the whole style of the new oasis and it s complex to be a bit over the top I don t really care for it s semi sort of scene they are trying to create I been going to the oasis for about now I remember when it was just a shack with a small menu and good view the view t the sunset was pretty we knew what we were getting into and it was a painless evening to unload our just don t go the best food in the area the iguana better better better chips and but oasis the location I should probably knock off a few for the fact we could hear the band over at the starlight stage covering bon shot to the heart and you re to blame you give love a bad name reallyA must visit if you re never been There are many different and a ton of outside seating all with great of the river and Food t worth your money but they had bud light for and an assortment of You can get a souvenir cup to take homeThis place great of Lake Travis however the food is not the best I was here for a wedding and it was a beautiful place to have a wedding great atmosphere were good food was I haven t tried the regular food but would go back to the place just for theI knew this place had average food That was because I checked the before I came here With this knowledge I ordered a because that is safe food in my book for any restaurant If you can t make a decent edible then you probably t be in business This place is obviously a tourist trap But it s a tourist trap with a view Lake Travis For how long the line was at the host stand we were seated promptly I was with the speed Oasis an abundance of staff so service was all pretty quick If you come here just don t come here thinking you re going to enjoy a decent lunch dinner You re coming here to enjoy a view with some with ruby food With that in mind you really can t complain too much about this placeThe most unexpected and fun place you could ever hope to come across Food was but the view over Lake Travis is spectacular This place is so cool quirky with a gorgeous view it is simply an experience Have a Drink or two and watch the sunset after you stroll the place and admire the HUGE collection of art unique furniture tables built into a cliff it us of the coast inGreat with inside and outside seating convenient valet parking and several adjacent Food was average service was average as well A good touristy place or a good place to have a group get togetherGreat Food is less than mediocre and wine selection is typical lake style as in just red or white I cannot understand why this place not set up an upscale section for who like their food wine and view combined I d pay more for quality and better As I am sure would Don t go here anything other than regular lake food and mediocre service But for a view and fried food it s heavenstar but no so great food My family and I came here Memorial Day weekend and it was crazy crowded We only to come here for and the gorgeous view since my sister said previously that the food t so great So after waiting a little while we got our table and ordered chips and and and fish Like my sister said the food is mediocre at best but this place is not about the food just about enjoying the sunset and the lovely Lake Travis First of all this place is It of four I believe They must have of being that there s a good bit of indoor and outdoor seating Being that this place is so big and crowded I m sure the get all the time which the service to be very as we had first hand experience Our server to keep forgetting about us and it took forever just to get the few we ordered Overall I recommend eating elsewhere before coming to The Oasis Come here for some and for the view and you leave a happy person unless the service is really bad that isThe view is absolutely beautiful but not the grandeur that I was from what my excited told me over the phone Their are HUGE I ordered the steak salad don t ask me I don t know I meat but not something extremely heavy and t really get to the salad part because there was just so much steak It was however a very tasty steak Overall the food and were good in an ordinary kind of way Oasis is not a place I would go back to for the food The wait staff was very friendly very peppy and also like some other very busy When we went the entire place was it me slightly of the at amusement noisy busy The noise however just kind of the beauty of the view over Lake Travis I think its Lake Travis Its a fun place though the kind of place you d go to out with and and the of the food are decent given the they serve I also think the and souvenir shop outside the restaurant are awesome So is the little golf cart that you from the parking lot to the hostess outside the restaurantI go here for the experience more than the food It s great to sit outside with all the tiered and the colorful The view from the lake is greatYou are a beautiful view of a sunset are Food is Sunset is fantastic Don t come here with big and you love it They are in the sunset selling business and have done a great job at it Service is pretty good and they are usually very willing to accommodate you with you sunset needsThe place is so beautiful the location is awesome and that s it So we came to this romantic place with my husband to watch the sunset and have a dinner We had some chips made an order and went to take some with the nice view of Lake Travis When we came back after couple another couple was sitting on our table and there t our water and chips on the table It they assumed that we left it was no more then that we been gone So we the situation to that couple and sit back to our table So then we been sitting with the empty table and t catch any waiter to ask about what s going with our food since they assumed we were gone It took sometime After all they brought us our but was all over the place and I specifically not to have anywhere close to my food So we had to call for a manager She came to ask after sometime to all the situation politely tried to solve the situation After all they gave us complimentary hot tea and dessert I really the gesture of a manager but to be honest all the food is so bad quality not delicious and The dessert were fine by the way The place is just worth visiting only if see the sunset viewThe only reason I m giving this place is because of the atmosphere and the amazing view The food like they just it on a skillet I had the and those were not that good Chips and were It is over priced food and but you are paying for the awesome sunset view and place and their Oasis is so huge I have not been here in a year and they are on I think they are trying to make the Oasis a small town It is ridiculously huge Definitely call for but is great for big tooThis was my first time back in eight I don t recall the food being that spicy the last time I was here I ordered the beef for which was way too spicy for me The head waiter t believe I thought the food was too spicy He did ask if I anything else on the menu like a salad but I declined There t any other on the menu that were gluten and cow dairy free and salad t do it for meThe self Sunset Capital of is indeed striking in it s of the water So much so that food that seem about to high won t give you a great deal of sticker shock That said I am of the opinion that the Oasis is a great place for a drink and an appetizer and just an place to actually have a full meal As you can imagine the best time to go to the Oasis is when it s warm outside and the sun is still up or at least still a way to go before it over the horizon There is a great deal of outside seating and the wait staff is attentive and courteous The sprawling Oasis facility a number of and where you can find dinner tables and live but the and view of the lake are the life blood of this placeThis place is about the view It s over priced I suggest going when they have a good band Have dinner somewhere else Food But when there is a good band it s actually a fun place to be And don t expect to be out late Band usually at Just when your fun it s bedtimeThis is how the will go So where are you going tonight Oh you want to go to the Oasis Well just you know the food is crap and you wont get in forever but the t too bad and the view is amazing I at the Oasis every night all during the summer and for that situation it was perfect Big floor Good music from The Brew friendly people This place is crowded though So so so crowded The tables are the is over worked and the food is not good Come by for a drink and a view that part is worth the trip out there But come on an off time the wait can deter those not it Personally for me I think this is one of the most beautiful in Their quick action after the fire a good part of the restaurant the serious dedication to getting a really beautiful place back in action as quickly as possible Its a must see forThe view is amazing I really the view and the atmosphere The only thing that t as great was the food It was nothing I d brag aboutLet s get this straight Go here for the amazing view and nothing else The food is and bad The are and watered down However the sunset over Lake Travis up for all of that Come here early to get an awesome seat and be the guest of honor that night who to ring the bell at sunset I been coming here for over and will still be in the future to show out of state The Oasis made wonderful after the fire in and the Starlight is better than ever Great place for live musicNot bad This place is definitely a good choice when you want a nice view Food is pretty average especially for the price are good and service was good It s a huge venue so it s great for and work Be prepared for lots of too Very family friendlyThis is a great place to bring out of for the view and to enjoy a drink If you simply MUST eat order or something safe Pay heed you will most likely suffer a cafeteria meal by the trucks adjacent to the restaurant i e do not have high Rather fill your belly at a happy local joint then finish your palate with a beer while gazing at the view I do not recommend the or the specialty either Other than being over priced they are too heavy on the mix and hurt your belly I realize they took a hit after the lightning strike but Oasis always in the culinary experience and to do so I just hope they come around soon One star is for food one star is for the view and another star is for summer nights at sunset when it s not Last summer each they had a live band and live instruction on and you d begin ing at sunset while the bell happy sweaty and magical Do not be afraid you don t have to know how to I sure as hell don tI went here for lunch The chips and were good The appetizer was good too I ordered Chicken The chicken was very dry and very little flavor The rice was not good that came with the was not good The flour tortilla was soft and I that and so were the with the I have had before and it Probably because of tasted better food now I can really distinguish between the good and badThree because the chips and they brought out at the beginning was really tasty Shrimp were what I would expect from cabana but not here On the plus side the that came with them were very good My lettuce wrap he said was good The double dip and was lame more for the price they have on it If the the food quality I would maybe come back but at the high they actually charge I save it for a better placePoor service and poor quality food BUT great view when the lake is full and bar upstairs some great and So just go up to because they also serve food with rotating food truck servingI was pretty disappointed with this place are amazing Service is slow atmosphere is so noisy food is nothing special me of s or other chain If be back but just for a drink or not the foodThe view from The Oasis on Lake Travis is definitely worth the trip I have to agree with many other when it comes to the food My family and I it safe with chips and so and the wonderful view There s also live music set up so that s a plus The dragon situation was a little weird The wait for the umbrella tables on the lower was long We decided to avoid that by going to the third level The view was still amazing and we got to avoid the heat If you re going to go here make sure it s for the view and not for the foodI m a fan but only of the view are watered down and the food is barely edible and over priced Everybody obviously comes for the view with their so your best bet is to drink a beer relax and enjoy the company Recent are really nice and the live music upstairs t a bad if you want to turn it into a whole night Best s cover band inYou re paying for the view at this restaurant The food is not great The sunset was beautiful but the service was just Took about until our waiter came to take our order but the food came out fast We only saw him like three times Ordered a that was probably the worst I ever tasted and sent it backAmazing view I had some appetizer and and was really good But in summer time they need to improve the or something to make the people more comfortable was really hot the last day i went to this placeWonderful view of Lake Travis BUT Food is average at best Luke warm Wait staff and hard to find at times Quality for price not good Go for view have a drink and appetizerThe view is about the only good thing here It is beautiful and seeing the sunset from here is a sight to see As far as the food goes its nothing to write home about Nothing to brag about They try to get you in and out right away A very busy placeThis place is The food is average and service is slow The view is beautiful for sure but honestly you re better off eating somewhere else and then just head towards Lake Travis itselfThe view was beautiful The food was not that great I had the shrimp which was good but My son had which was a pile of chips with whole Who does that My husband had the pork which he had barbecue sauce on them The were good but overall tooIt s the view that is definitely worth the drive out of downtown If you get there around they are pretty busy and the won t get to you as often As a result food to the table around after you order The Oasis t take either Food and drink is average I would go only to see the sunset and to say I went to one of s must eatNice view Too expensive Waitress are not too nice The are not worth It like you are paying just for the view because food quality is not very goodLocation Location Location A for the cliffside Lake Travis and the Hill Country observation deck new since they rebuilt And I always the and abundant eclectic and When I come here I feel like I m on vacation because this place is after all a destination It s a great place to take out of town Yeah the food is less than spectacular I think they actually have better at The is basically On my recent visit I tried something off their breakfast menu the green chili omelet which was not very tasty and barely had any cheese or contents The potatoes were mushy and without much flavor but at least the fruit cup was good So far the best thing I had here is the with chicken But I found after margarita or two while enjoying the view I can get over the mediocre food Tip skip the valet and park it yourself in the new covered garage it s just a short walk on over to the OasisThe view was amazing I really the view The only problem was the quality of the meal It was an average foodThey get a star for the atmosphere Another for the view And another for night I m knocking off a star because the food is god awful And another because it s The taste like lemon lime and the food like a s dinner I recommend eating somewhere else and then coming here for the sunset and or night Have funThe food was pretty good and the view was excellent The price t match the food so know that you are really paying for the viewVery touristy but the meal was actually pretty good There t a long wait and our waitress was lovely Don t be by the price the food t going to knock your off I would recommend getting here in the late afternoon or in time to watch the sun set from one of the outsideOh my god they turned this place into When I lived in this joint was literally ONE building with a great view Now it s World with a bunch of of and a great view I still think the view is worth the trip but for s sake do not bother to come here at a popular time like a weekend night Make sure you come here off peak day off peak time like a at p m and DEFINITELY NOT IN THE SUMMER WHEN ITS Their A C is the worst and I thought I was going to DIEAn obligatory tourist destination because of its lake view yes now you can see that we re still alarmingly low on water in the area and its decorative allure The Oasis from a quaint local destination treat into an amusement center for Or at least that s how I it recently to a group of doubtful from out of town They were sold on it once we No cotton candy necessary The restaurant itself is worth a quick tour but be advised that the food is fairly and well known to be average in quality and that there will usually be a wait to get in If you see a long line snaking into the parking lot you know you re in the right place A lot of people just go for and the sunset applause is obligatory but after a couple of you will totally join in Downstairs is an interesting covered patio section Starlight Lounge that a cover band and and most of the week The wait may be shorter for this section but be advised that most of it t really include a clear lake view if that s what you came out for The complex around it some interesting local with one of a kind and the center a wine taste tour once a month for a nominal fee that a charity There s also a coffee shop and a fro yo place downstairs So if you arrive and are by the wait you can always walk around and have a coffee or a fro yo There s a catwalk to the right of the restaurant that a nice perch for a photo You can also view from a distance the owner s castle home adjacent to the complex Is there no limit to this man s wealth and creativity I used to recommend that people skip over to Uncle Billy s instead better food same view but their they re closed for the season winter Tell me it t so So if you want to eat with that view for now you re just going to have to cue up with theFirst meal of our first trip in for a party The food was two Scenery was so beautiful at sunset But the best part was our waiter Ask for him when you stop byDon t go for the food you will be disappointed This place is The View and the which was the only thing we ate all night It s a nice place to take but it s just that nice The food was in my opinion very blah and veryBreath taking view Sub par food I mean really this place could really have amazing food if they but it that they are more about high traffic mass produced food Drink selection at bar is Fresh lime would be nice The sweet and sour they made my margarita with must have been the generic they could find are dry and cold All the food I literally think s better food I mean it Everyone it too You would think they would approach this problem and get and higher quality food but it s always been this way at the Oasis It like the are too cheap to fix it They over charge for the food too which would be if I eating it Service is hit or miss Nonetheless I will reluctantly return the view is amazing They are also known for the best sunset view in And I it s true I hear that they do upstairs routinely and that it s a pretty partyAs everyone else said the atmosphere here is incredible Simply the size of the place is awesome and the view is sweet I need to come here sometime during the summer The food is fine like everyone else said I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was fine The waitress was attentive and nice I how nicely decorated the place was forWow this place from ago but I guess so have I Back then it was a local wood structure with an awesome lake view Now It still the view but apparently the old building burned down a few ago and the owner built a HUGE facility and mall in its place I d the owner continued to pay the while the place was rebuilt like a really nice person It s well done and nice and all I just miss the more intimate less touristy feel of the old place That said it still one of the best in and should probably be on the list of to hit if you never been in before The food is very average but remember you re there for the incredible viewmediocre food BEAUTIFUL an staple service was great we came on night but that did not disrupt our amazing and attentive We got an amazing table that was I believe on the Crow s nest There was one other small table for two next to us and our table of was able to witness a proposal so sweet anyhow if you re not very hungry just come for a few and a dirty margaritaThe Oasis on Lake Travis is a tourist destination off Lake Travis in where you shopping one of the best sunset in Yes it s nothing like what it used to be a charming restaurant with average food and an amazing view Now it s a huge tourist complex with average food an amazing view I get it If you re here you re here for the view If you want good food downtown in away My Overall Rating Atmosphere Service Food Return Atmosphere The Oasis on Lake Travis more of a theme park feel than a cozy restaurant There s now a huge level parking complex valet parking shopping and multiple with live music on most nights Oh year it also to overlook the west side of Lake Travis meaning if you re here during the evening you may get a spectacular view I don t know how much I want to stress this it s an awesome view And if you come all this way this is what you want to experience Star Service I was here for a private party and we had a space with our own staff They were extremely nice and helpful doing everything from the bar dinner and of course serving our dinner Not sure what service is like in the normal restaurant by my experience was great Star Food We had a dinner that of a great nicely seasoned shrimp cocktail along with a fried snapper with salad Who am I the food was good but not great Again understand you re here for the view and if you really are here for the food someone you Star Will I Return Only with other The Oasis on Lake Travis is a GREAT location to visit if you want to wow someone with a great view Throw in live music a party atmosphere and it should make any tourist happy I would take my out of state here I would come for a private party but I would never come here on my own if food was the reason why Keep that in mind if you ever visit Star My Yelp Rating Scale Sum of all Star Atmosphere Is it a cool dive Perhaps an upscale place No matter the type atmosphere a big part and I give a star if I like it or it great charm Star Service You can have a great meal with bad service But that s also what can make a five star joint drop to four It s important to the dining experience that service is great and on point Food I award up to two for the food since this is the main reason we dine out Sometimes the extra star is given for value but it s really all about the food Star Will I come back If I know for a fact I return I give this a star A place to make an impression for me to return Each Category can be given up to star except food because I consider all these important to the overall dining experience I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp scoreOne of most tourist traps I admire their connection to nature and the beauty of the landscape Even though it was well past sunset I could still see the on the lake and that was pretty enough Atmosphere was loud and obnoxious I have a major peeve for any place where I can t converse with the people next to me I am glad they had a live band but the got kind of after awhile Food is not so bad as it is for what it is Their menu also from a lack of light and discount I think the item there is like No garden salad I had a margarita there which was though hardly amazing All Said I am glad I went but have no to go again Other people there to be a good time and I really watching the people dance which was about all I could do because I was unable to hold a conversation with the person next to me It did however get creepy when everyone singing along to theCome here for the view We had a nice sunset dinner and it was beautiful The food is mediocre We had chips and Nothing spectacular to match our amazing view Great place to around grab a drink watch the sunset in front of a fire with your if food was would give this place aFive for view Two for food Went on a early evening got a GREAT table with an incredible view The service was pretty good but the food was blah I the waiter what he and his suggestion was the craw fish They were awful The filling was and the sauce had no kick to it I was just visiting so I m not sure it someplace else a comparable view and better food if not I d probably go back for the viewI haven t been here in Yes the view is stunning Yes the food is average Yes the come out of a large plastic mixer bottle But it was a wedding anniversary celebration for some I was more than a little at the physical of the place since it had been so long since I was there Oasis went and got dressed up after the fire indeed The food as I recall was a little better this time than on previous The view is still amazing The still But the service was agreeable the were pleasant and right on schedule the sun did in fact set I can t complain And just as a silver lining since the t amazing there was no danger of over indulging before the long drive back to Round Rock See how I did that Turning a negative into a positive it s a wonder I am not in marketing A I d go back especially if you wereThis place is fine It s been said before you don t go to the Oasis for the food and I think there are comparably priced on the lake with at least as good of and better food this is officially my review ever I don t really feel like I can leave it at that But I m going to make myself walk awayA friend told us we had to see this place The view is amazing oh my word This restaurant is in the rich part of town and you can tell when you drive there Almost anywhere you sit outside on the patio you will have a good view You can actually just walk through to the patio take your pic and leave The menu was a little but they do need to make their money We about for a strawberry margarita and for So if you are going here for a date your going to spend a lot of money The margarita was on point so I want disappointed If your coming down to see the sunset come down min before as the wait can be long depending on the day So worth the trip to this placeThe is solely for the location and view The food is terrible usually cold and taste like it comes from a box the are and no matter what you ask for unless you are physically watching them pour at the bar you are getting well liquor this literally every time I and it s pretty well known to that you will get a long wait in the heat terrible service lousy food and watered down however the best view Wish they d clean up their act because the location can t be beat on Lake TravisThe food is flavorful the service is good The host welcoming is not attentive They lounge around and gossip The manager to have no control of the staff The tables are ALWAYS dirty from my experience I have to ask for my table to be down again each visit The View the food and worth the experience I literally just watched a bus boy clean a table across from me and there were still food and left when he was finished Most of the staff are young teens who probably do not understand the value of presentation and sanitation I have made to their management concerning the LACK of Cleanliness and nothing This is my last time visiting this establishment I have had some awesome during my here and some great w family I hope the management team can tighten up on their cleanliness issue I m sure that would have a positive outcomeThree only for the view Food mediocre at best Service usually good but today waitress upset that t upgrade to premium Rita even though spouse bought premium drink t bring water as first while we at menu Food tepid but brought quickly Churning table Never had a chance to order beer with meal or dessert as waitress check on table and said take your time Always tip well as hard job but not this time Come for the view not the food For the price and talent at the entrance should be better food like brewery and other t make it Too bad for a beautiful spot on the lakeGreat scenery and Food was service was good for mediocre food But again the view is awesome Had dinner with the wife and we had a good timeIt is sad to say that such a beautiful venue could destroy a meal The thing is it is not for a lack of trying the kitchen manager what he does and when u talk to him it is obvious that he is restrained from doing great The kitchen staff take pride in the work they do The food is made made from scratch So what is the issue Why is the food so bad The phrase is simple High end t computeIf you come here for the view not the food you be fine was like water and the Red Sauce on my cold tasted like tikka think sugar Completely inedible I understand the are the only decent thing on the menu so try that The blended special were good They told us wait was but we sat down at an empty table and no more than so that s goodOasis is all about The food is Not my favorite dining spot although there are plenty of and you can t go wrong with chips and But the on the extensive patio make this place totally worth it Come here enjoy some and you be loving lifeWell this place is known for the beautiful sunset that it only right WRONG or at least when I went there The place live music that mostly normal people would know in addition to that there is a dance floor which of course my choir spring trip with my troop and I made sure to make use of It was an amazing experience Notice how not about the food and yet this is a Well the food t outstanding it was average but the live music breath taking view friendly atmosphere and an open dance floor made up for it If you are into sight seeing this is definitely the place So I gave this a three for the food thats all if this t mainly a but a bar it would beBeautiful view so worth the visit Good service if you get the right server Ask for and are great The place is huge so not an intimate dining experience if that is what you are looking forGood food and a great view but it really hot with the sun around dinner timeMy salad was delicious and my husband his But our sent their back Server was quick to take the off the bill Sunset view was amazingonly because I t give them And the is only for the view and the setting Needless to say the food is far from what should be of such a nice looking place Sadly it like they just threw a menu together after designed this place The margarita was tasty but the chicken I had was no whopping And that margarita was so small I m thinking they re just trying to get there money back for spent so much on the place because it was that tasty The End ByeFood is for quality WAY so if you want check out the oasis brewery on the floor when you re the entrance to the oasis restaurant veer right up some to the brewery and drink some awesome beer and munch on great pub foodThis is a place for I m going to agree with the other who said you go for the view not the food I t by my meal but I was with the view We got some great sunset and watched as other like us did the same Service was friendly and we got in on a evening just before sunset without to wait The surrounding development is still newish so some have yet to be filled If this were just a restaurant I would have been a little disappointment considering how far we had to drive to get here But after dinner and photo we around and checked out the other If I were local this would be the kind of place I d dread to go back to Go once and you seen it all But if you want to appreciate a beautiful Hill Country view over Lake Travis its worth a visitThis is a place you go to have a drink and look at the view not to eat the food That s what I had been told before I got here and thought Some people are hard to please Nope The food is simply not good Service can be really even if they re well meaning and nice I had a frozen and it was simply The only reason I would go back is to look at the view but honestly I d be happier looking at it from the brewery next doorCool place but it s a tourist attraction NOT a solid The food is moderate but if you live in it s not a place you want to go regularlyBased on the location The Oasis It one of the most beautiful in all of However the food is consistently mediocre and is very over priced For example a plate of is with no meat Yes just cheese and pico Their are Ridiculous Taking family and from out of town here is definitely a must but you definitely want to avoid dining in here Plan to grab a couple of enjoy some chips and and take in the beautiful view Then hop on Yelp and find yourself one of the many great in to treat your companyThe food is only but the view is great I like the other they have added as wellYou go for the location and not the food On a beautiful day there are few like the Oasis to feel like you are on vacation right in Central Service is fair at best as is the food Wish they would try a little harder to be more than a tourist trap but then again they are busy and surely are making money So it s up to us to decide how much to support them besides the obligatory out of town visitor cocktail visitMy sister and her family took us here on a afternoon We sat on one of the though not right at the edge I say the kept us cool but were quite noisy I think I would have preferred to sit inside The food is with some spicy ketchup as This is one of those where you go for the view more than the foodThe view is just awesome The view over a lake which is a very beautiful place to have lunch The food is good not greatNow we t able to get an actual table because the wait was a bit ridiculous being almost two but we did get to see the sunset here which is really what most people are coming for The restaurant four of tables on the side of the hill which you can look out over the lake Everyone when the sun does set and that s about it You can catch a tram to e parking lot so you don t have to walk which is nice Not sure I need to come back but it was fun as a tourist stop overThe Oasis grown a lot since the first time we went there ago I have to say I it better when it was smallerPopular with and alike to enjoy the of Lake Travis from the hillside Expect to wait This massive restaurant and bar multiple with a large open seating bar area and stage for live music on the third floor There is definitely much better cuisine for the price than the food found here but that s not really what you come here for You come to sit and relax out on the outdoor and enjoy the scenic of Lake Travis and the amazing that can be hereGreat place to enjoy a drink and a great view Not a meal I can go into great length with a wordy review but it is very simple This is not a place to go for dinner The food is not worth the wait the wait staff is very young and extremely unprofessional and there is a major issue with the kitchen If you are going to visit Oasis then I would suggest going there just before sunset a drink from the bar standing on one of their many and watching the sun set It truly is beautiful out thereIt s a bit poor for service here The seem lazy The food took awhile but the view is just amazing I got the red fish with Style the fish was pretty dry and not at all worth the price ofI agree with what a lot of people say The food is decent at best but the view is TERRIFIC Actually I just like the general atmosphere of the place It s like casual upscale if that any sense The location is pretty nice and the really are that nice If you can get there in time for the sunset then it s pretty cool In fact a lot of people especially those who been drinking will applaud at the sunset which is amusing The food I t think was really that bad Apparently it used to be a lot worse ago but then they switched the and when I was there last I t have any real It is a little for the quality of what you re getting but it t horrible I forget the name of the dish I had but it was like their most expensive thing only because I don t go there often at all It was like and it had some steak shrimp fish and shrimp I thought it was decent enough I haven t been here in like a year and a half but last I went they were doing a ton of construction like expanding the restaurant which already like people altogether or something ridiculous in parking and in this art gallery or something I m sure they re done with most of it and someone who can elaborate on that but I believe they re trying to make it into this big area where people can sell their or something In short the food is decent and kind of expensive but it is a great place to have with enjoy the view and chill If only they really would just improve the food then this would be a truly excellent placeThese are the I love about the Oasis view of lake Travis even during the dry season Beautiful sunset they hit the gong and everyone and when the sun goes down into the horizon you feel a part of a dear tradition Fun festive atmosphere yes in spite of all the mediocre mine this place is always pack with cheerful smiling fun dressing people mostly Awesome free live music and dancing at the Starlight lounge on the floor cover on on on Great for too especially on nights when the music is more family I love seeing my yr old son dancing with the little to music Here are the major Food is not worth the cost Too crowded especially on the weekend Parking is almost impossible The Oasis is min from my house and I used to go there every weekend I tried almost everything on the menu to justify dinner there but have long given up I cannot find anything that s worth there for the cost So we ended up eating dinner somewhere else and going there for only which are pretty decent However ever since they turned the whole Oasis area into a shopping mall parking which was pretty bad before become impossible They built a floor garage which still barely the popular traffic there The last couple of times we tried to go to the Oasis on a weekend we could not find parking anywhere so we ended up going somewhere else I am sad I wish I can go back there more often it s still one of my favorite out Maybe after they upgrade that parking garage to floorThe number one thing I look for in a restaurant The food Yes you can and about lots of at the Oasis and cheer when the sun but I found their food to be just average I had much better at little hole in the wall here inOverall eating here was a good experience The view was absolutely gorgeous the lake and the sunset during dinner made for beautiful However the food was average I definitely had better food The t rolled like normal instead they were layered like a The rice it came with had a weird taste so after a few I t touch it again the live music and the of the restaurant but most likely t come back and pay for the foodMediocre food but great view The Oasis a stunning view over the lake something you t believe could happen so close to a city Unfortunately for us it was gloomy and rainy so we t enjoy sitting outside in the terrace Food wise The Oasis t impress also the are just for the experience if you don t care about the foodI love this place but not for its food The view is spectacular and the restaurant is beautiful and wonderfully decorated There are great to shop nearby I have such awesome of The Oasis however the food and at times the service been consistentlyI been waiting for a nice weather day to go and check out the view from this place to Lake Travis I went recently and I was rather There t anything incredible about our visit but given the I had read on yelp I thought it was going to be way worse The food was service was but the weather and the view were incredible I d recommend to everyone to go and check it outThis is probably in the other but I feel The view and general environment is awesome There s not much like it in or in general for that matter It is truly beautiful and awe inspiring With that said the food is really bad It s disappointing because the restaurant such potential with its location and The food is just truly bad though The are limited and you will certainly regret eating whatever you order Also the service is really bad The wait staff is not very attentive and they don t come around that often It s pretty to have to wait for bad food especially when you know it s going to be bad Anyways the view and environment are enough to give this placeThe view and ambience is pretty amazing but the food could be better It s mostly andUsed to come here ago and can honestly say it just as welcoming as it always The are greatBeautiful venue Terrible service First time to The Oasis and came to a beautifully decorated entrance with spectacular of Lake Travis All from the comfort of a covered patio and blowing to ensure comfort off with chips and which to be all home made Chips were delicious and the was as well and had a slight kick to it Took a while to get which was simply just water I was seated promptly but my order t taken for I was fed up waiting and was about to leave when a waiter finally I t Salmon and it was beautifully plated and it was quite delicious I overall the meal but I ran out of water and the waiter never came by to refill The venue was wonderful The service is however terrible They need to overhaul this system to get rated betterLike many in The Oasis a slightly over puffed status as an institution We can t help but brag we love our city Yes the view is incredible Borderline But to get to that view you have to suffer through a semi long hill country drive don t take the carsick breed and some mediocre food In fact I don t want to be harsh but the food is just bad My ranked among the worst I and the were limp and semi warm My out of town guest was equally displeased with her cheeseburger Our waiter could not have been more disinterested in us we re boring fair enough and the are ridiculous for the food to dollar ratio I give Oasis three for the concept the indoor outdoor seating the free plastic cup keepsake the and yes the view OasisBack when I was in my early s I this place It was great to see the magnificent on the lake and booze it up with my other drunken Maybe if I had been a little less up I would have how poor the food was I suggest going here at least once but that will probably be more than enoughMore of the middle the wait t bad even near sunset on a The food was alright large about in line with the and better than decent on taste for chicken breast stuffed with and another stuffed with some thing were well Service mixed might well be all on Total about right but not that excitingI agree with the consensus average to bad food great view To be completely honest though the view t that great to other around the U S world It is good for that s all Let s face it Lake Travis t the most picturesque lake any of us been to and eating average food and looking at Lake Travis is If it is nice outside then the place is great because it a gigantic outdoor seating area Add a band that good music start dancing and it is worth going I would eat somewhere else along the way and make it there for the sunsetI come here over and over solely based on the view There is always an extremely long wait and the food is very mediocre I always either order the cheese or steak Both pretty good but I have definitely had better If anything I suggest The Oasis as a cool down margarita spot on the patio Don t waste your money on the foodThe Oasis is a hard place to rate It for the view and wow factor for a beautiful sunset It does get ZERO for food and service I actually believe the food and service get progressively worse with each visit while as Lake Travis the view more spectacular Never go for food and expect terrible service but the are cold and wet and the view is worth the inconvenienceWe love the Oasis for the placement and The food like many have said leaves much to be desired We been there multiple times and now when we go we just get the because we know it s a safe choice No one can really mess up The rice is I m and I can tell you it s not rice and the are canned not slow overnight like grandma used to make The is good but the tortilla chips are the thin that are more like eating plastic than a real corn ship The are good because are usually always good and the view is astonishing Go there for the view have a few and then hit Bell on the way home You save money and get comparable foodthis place an amazing view I almost seeing it From just before sunset sunset and evening I was by the colors the beauty and the trip completely worth it This is a unique place From the small pod to the moose bench to the mermaid sculpture to jump from the top it is all unique intriguing and a fun experience But all the tables are plastic something I hate With such a stunning view I guess I hoped from more than cheap plastic tables Maybe a silly wish Then when we were seated a huge fan was blowing on me and being a girl with long hair that can be problematic plus though I can understand due to the heat I guess there would just be a better way to adjust the fan rather than to have to turn it off I ordered the pretty tasty but nothing amazing Lots of food though too much really Fairly expensive for just standard Also I ordered a few They were almost as good as the sunset In general no one amazed by the food but it was pretty good overall and in company better The staff was nice attentive quick and made sure to check we had all we A unique place a beautiful food and decent foodBeautiful view Nice outdoor Pretty limited Wish they had better and food such a waste for the viewThe location is the BEST part about this place The are great They have a lot of seating but service is slow Really slow You sit there enjoy the view for awhile then the food comes out and eat Average food big It got when I came to eat with a group but we got to see the sunset which was nice I would only come back just to see the niceGreat location incredible stunning landscape Now food and wise crap food and decent service Not a place I would frequentBeautiful The shopping are nice It is a town with all the available The area is highly over priced and the food is minimalIt s all about the view for this The food is mediocre My love to go there every year on the way home from summer camp It s become a traditionI been to the Oasis Bar and Tavern up on level before but this time my whole family came and t want to be around the loud albeit good music as my are young and it them So we went down to The Oasis SERVICE The greeter was really friendly and us nicely We were told that a table for would be at least a thirty minute wait but like amusement the wait was shorter and turned out to be Our waiter was nice enough but pretty tired The guy who brought out our food with was really gruff and not nice at all The food came at a good time not too early not too late ATMOSPHERE This place is fun It me of an amusement park restaurant not sure if that s good or bad though It is very loud and surprisingly dark once the sun People are noticeably drunk not in your face drunk more playful FACILITY It definitely t In N Out regarding cleanliness There were and of chips the ground around the tables Great view but you can only see it well if you go out to the balcony which is quite crowded Great and building FOOD First of all my were there and had the which t very creative see The regular menu about none of which are super original We had just regular chips and Let me just say that the chips honestly like they warmed up a bag of and it in a basket The was good although I t tell how real it was It tasted which personally I like I got the They had good flavor although they were massively overdone or something The bark was too thick the meat was near impossible to get off the bone and personally I would have a steak knife to break them apart They came with coleslaw which was mediocre and sweet potato that were with honey DRINK You have to ask for water My got a and said it was good but way too sweet My got which had barely any grenadine in them Every single drink came in these dumb plastic Even my s came in a smaller plastic cup At a restaurant I want to drink from a glass PRICE Way too I think they the since the other were here too for OR is way too much VERDICT All in all I think that everyone should come here at least once because it s a staple of Lake Travis Yes the are nice but you get an even better one and better everything if you go upstairs to the Tavern And if you want to get away from the then go a few down the shore to Rough Hollow s club restaurant It free valet parking too it s view is almost as nice as The Oasis This whole experience really gave me a long a million tables tired staff food and royally expensive But like will love this place it even a small arcade totalGreat and wonderful music Good and that would get you five but the food was star at best sorryThe food is just the view is great service was too but the restaurant t busy when I was there The special of the day was out so I went for the menu to brag about there I had a decent cost and that s pretty much the best part Good place to take a date but for the price you can get much better foodThis was the place to see the sunset over Lake Travis back in the day meaning early s when it was a quaint patio bar way out of the way from the big city of Now s grown substantially over the and from reading the so the Oasis Apparently it s not the quaint hole in the wall place it was It s never been known for its food so it like that t Too bad it s more of a tourist trap now but I d probably go back to relive that sunset one more time when I m back in the areaSuch a spectacular view It was so neat and sitting with the view of the water I believe the view and the of the restaurant is what people in It is such a big place and I believe they are a tad because service is slow I had a terrible experience the bean and cheese I ordered it without cheese because I don t eat dairy or red meat In the description of the it listed out all of the except a MAJOR one PORK I haven t had pork since I was and because of a poor description and no notice I was starting eating a dish that pork I was beyond upset and felt super sick to my stomach I to cry They did pay for my meal but I feel like the manager coming over would have been nice I just hope in the future they let people know because a good percentage of the world t eat read meat I was crying too because it mad me really upset As far as the food goes it t anything crazy good It is your typical bar food The are what to go for Definitely awesome well flavored and strong Even though I had the experience I had I would still go back for that view and theGave three for the view and convenience of other and The food t good and is definitely Seating is and is pretty normally Awesome and worth a trip just for thatThe view is It s truly The food is mediocre at best but you come here for the not the food as much The Oasis very busy especially around sunset but we came here for lunch so it t as bad It was still busy but we t have to wait to be seated The Oasis food They bring you a round of chips and to start Being our group of t too terribly hungry we decided to share the with meat It was huge and pretty tasty Nothing spectacular for though My fiance and I both ordered a Hurricane and we got to keep the complimentary Oasis glass it came in We visiting our friend on a beautiful spring day Lake TravisThe view was good but not the food The one thing that I like was the cheese pot withThe venue is great superb of Lake Travis the view a with both indoor and outdoor seating Other gift all in the same complex You may have to walk a bit from your car to get to the actual restaurant Plenty of tables and haven t had to wait long at all The food is not bad not great and the service is marginal Even with a lot of trying to flag one down is a challenge and you may not see your server for a while kind of annoying when they have your food but forgotten to give you silverware to eat with They all to have a not my job attitudeGreat friendly and food My husband s was missing that fresh minty flavor His fish were but there t anything special about them My shrimp were better than my hubby s fish The black that came with my meal were way too watery and the on my hubby s plate just t have any special flavor to them The rice we both had t impressive The Brisket appetizer needs to be It was a pizza kind of appetizer The to be a little to hold the Red onion would been better than the onion they had on it The avocado on it was a little weird and felt out of place on the dishJust Way and full of themselves Probably won t go again feelThe and with chips was good For dinner I had the It was good but to brag about It was a very pretty restaurant though and no matter where you sit outside you have a beautiful view of the lakenot that great but a nice spot for a view hard to find but the are fun to drive downThis place is fine for a casual dinner with a great view It s actually a pretty cool place with the different and because the restaurant is in an area where there are a bunch of other to go after gift other with music Food was fine chicken HUGE but also kind of expensive You don t really go there for the food experience it s average you go for the view and the opportunity to go elsewhere for entertainment afterwards I really a golf cart take me from my car to the restaurantI understand it s the view and the opportunity to see soccer leave their dignity and a half of drunken glass of at the bar as they scramble to pick up their from soccer I get it However my last encounter turned out to have none of the Bartender was funny beer was cold not watered down and the experience which is the only reason to go to the Oasis was good The Oasis its and not just watered down Staff and are attentive The view is great but you have to pay for it Don t get me wrong I be backI went there with a group of five for lunch on a weekday The food t as horrible as I have mine was actually pretty good but it t anything entirely impressive either The view of the restaurant is fantastic The restaurant is huge with so many to look at do I would go again for the view and My with the restaurant was the service It t completely horrible but not very good either I could tell our waitress had too many tables Also one of the people I was with got the wrong dish When you pick black or His entire dish was the wrong one and when he said something to the server the only thing that was was If you don t like the black we can give you He black He t cause a fuss and ate the dish he was anyway Also another problem was they t let us split the check in any way A minor inconvenience Overall we were happy with the taste of our food they do have a pretty reasonably priced lunch menu View is amazingLike everyone The view is awesome The food is just I had the beef and my wife had the My had the cheese and were not I will probably be back but just for a few and and not any time soon Once a year is good for and a glimpse of the sun settingWe went to a wedding here a few ago The at this venue are beautiful and truly an unique venue Lake Travis I think Oasis would be good for with people or less The wedding I had over people from what the bride told me and it felt cramped The layout of the banquet room is long and narrow with the dance floor in a different room We had heavy at the wedding with wine and beer The food left a lot to be desired I had high that the less than stellar food I often read about on yelp would have been better for a wedding As I was in line to get food the which were just cut in half were cold How on earth are they going to let cold come out of the kitchen They also had some cheese crackers spinach dip and s The food was just kind of blah The one shining star was the bacon wrapped shrimp The shrimp was perfectly and had a great flavor with the sauce We had a wonderful time with our but I don t think I would recommend Oasis to to host their weddingThis place a great view and patio and is a great place to take people from out of town The downside The food and it s Go here for a special date or with people from out of town Otherwise stay awayFive for view Three for cleanliness and food Depending on what you order you can have either a really EH meal or a really good one Today our table went for one order of chicken and one order of shrimp Chicken was really good shrimp t that great kind of and Their is really good not very flavorful but add salt and lime and you are good to On the other hand their is spicy but really loose Off the menu the which are spicy chicken are not too good only because I found them spicy but boring overall The salad is good on the beef but uneven on the Sometime they are really fresh like today at lunch Other times they are bland and looking like last time Our waiter was friendly and efficient but his shirt was so and dirty I was rather turned off It can be like that But man you can not beat that viewI had to struggle to give it a star considering that ago we used to come to this place several times during the summer and drink and munch away the afternoon waiting for that glorious sunset Well the sunset was as spectacular as it was those ago but the Oasis is just too much of a place to be before sunset There was a hour wait just to get a table and by then it t worth it since the sun s no longer in the picture We did sneak upstairs to the Oasis brewing company deck and found a table there and had some but the food selection up there was abhorrent Very small menu and stuff that t fare well for our group of so we just had and watched the sunset I m glad we were able to see the sunset over a full lake but I m afraid the Oasis is just way way too big for us to come back It is now a destination type of place with lots of and to spend money and the food were as high as your location relevant to proper I guess if you re new or in from out of town then sure you don t know better You probably are used to waiting for a table in Wow I really do miss the old Oasis Damn that lightening strike I think that was the catalystHonestly I wish I could give the oasis because they have one of the if not the in when you want to have a romantic date night what better thing to do than go have dinner and watch the sunset with some nice However this is really not the place to eat The menu is so boring and over priced we went there and on a couple to wait for the sun to start to set before dinner and during the hour We sat there looking over the menu and after still not finding anything We we decided to leave and go eat elsewhere This place would be perfect if they would just spice up the menu a little give more But if your just looking for good and a beautiful view this place is goodThis place definitely an amazing view When we arrive the the to make sure the sun t shining in our At first I thought they would be blocking our view but just before sunset they come around and take down the so you have a great view I agree with the other that the food here kind of and you are essentially paying for the view I do not however agree that the service was terrible Our waitress came back and checked on us regularly She was super nice With how many tables there are in this place I was at how attentive they were Give the staff some credit There are something like tables here All in all I would definitely come back to sip on a few and enjoy the viewThe view is and the food is star I would definitely recommend visiting at least once I will be back to see the sunsetReally beautiful place The are good food not so great just average Service was If they improve the food this would be a fantastic place Maybe they have just gotten away from providing spectacular food just because of the sheer beauty of the placeGreat location and awesome of Lake Travis Live music on which is fun Food is average and food are Go for a beer at sunset and head elsewhere for dinner Worth for another couple of if it s and you like the band which we did Ginger was coolLet me sum this place up by saying this If you are going here for the food dont bother This restaurant it s ambience and the view of the lake is incredible Of course right now we are in the middle of a serious The food is WAY over priced and the taste is average at best Do yourself a favor Meet your for a few sit out on the terrace and watch the sun go down Then head back to town for dinner I dont mind paying more for food but it to be good foodA bunch of so far that are dead on My quick Food review Fish were good but nothing special pork were great Atmosphere Great Service was borderline Wait staff t was prompt but not very friendlyWe love the view and we knew even before we went that you don t go for the food you go for the view We have been several times and have had a good experience While we the and and the alcoholic their food is not where it should be for the price of the food and location of the restaurant But for the view it is worth just going and chips and a few and enjoy the night with or your one I really wish they would either change their of their food or bring the quality of it upFood is just are awesome Super touristy so I only come when there are in town Not a place I would frequent but is a nice option for to show them Lake TravisFood is horrible here Don t come for the food Come for the and eat before you come The are acceptable but this place is all about theThe view is amazing strong and the service is fantastic Unfortunately the kitchen needs some help My table of all were very by the food taste All three of the chicken came out cold I would also suggest that they toast the pretzel If management made a few to the menu and food prep this place would shineThe restaurant probably food that is just and because it t taste fresh So the are in part for the view It s a panoramic view of the hill countryside along Lake Travis The service was really great The waitress was new but was very enthusiastic and provided prompt service So the next time I go it will be just for and dessertCome here for the atmosphere and great view The food is not the best We got crown n n we got brown in a cup but it was not crown Not down with the brown that was not crownTourist trap Good for big not romantic though me of something you d find on a beach front in except it s sized and on a drying out lake Our were bees that would not leaves us alone though Maybe cause the were too sweet Fish and shrimp are though if you are going to eatNot all it s cracked up to be The food was mediocre service attentive Bell and felt like I was in the tourist trap from hell Well That s exactly how it s I had the and could tell if there was any booze in it the fresh lime juice totally any unique Unfortunately we came for lunch so t able to be by a subsetI was going to give this place but decided on ONLY because of the view The view is everything The place is quite spectacular with their eclectic it up to tables with different terrace Now for the food and It s sad to see such a great place such mediocre food and They even make a decent order of chicken without messing it up brought us beef mixed with chicken and the and sour cream were not enough for the pile of tortilla chips and were all mixed together in the center the and melted cheese were hard and the tortilla chips werent fresh Not even the were that great We ordered which are nothing special My aunt thought hers tasted like fake margarita mix flavoring and hers in for a beer My cousin ordered wine and said it t great either HOWEVER it is a great place to watch the sunset and chill out I recommend going there for not dinner and skip the at least the regular one I know they are trying to diversify and have recently a Mediterranean restaurant next door that a different look and feel but same great view I saw their and t think it was bad would be a good alternative to considerLike everyone else I have to say the are amazing The food service and are sub par Before posting my review I read the first or so for the Oasis They all say the food and service All the know not to come here for a fantastic meal So I am wondering if the owner these and to himself everyone my food maybe I should change the menu hire new and look at my price Or if he his food is great and the rest of is bat crazy Or maybe just maybe he he enough money off of the alcohol and chips and that he doesnt need to worry about selling more foodThis was just a little but the view was awesome we had to sit in walkway and the waiter had a top and two other tables the food was good but I think we were a little more They need to lower on a little muchAnd the are basically for fantastic and grounds Honestly skip the food just go for the drive catch the sunset and and wonder the grounds There is such a random eclectic array of stuff you keep you the first time Just take a look at the I posted and you seeFood is but the are Ample parking but you might have to walk a little to get to the restaurant Food is on the side but not that considering the It could be worse and honestly I had worse food too Someone Ranch as alternative and it does have great too but the food is also and really expensive At least here it s Lake Travis is absolutely beautiful and the whole of the area is awesome Little nearby to look around while you wait and boy will you wait When I came it was during graduation so it took about for us to be seated No unfortunately I imagine it s less during other peak times but it felt like we were there for forever However we did get to see the sunset and it was beautiful In general not a bad place to be with family or even a date Food is so average and even the t that good I mean I have never met a I t like This one tasted way too thin like everything was blended together No texture at all I got the pork and they were not very good The pork was way too sweet for my taste I think the best food item we had was the chicken If you get one thing make sure to order that for everyone to try So so good Small chicken with wrapped in bacon and then covered in a sweet glaze Definitely must try If I go back I am definitely getting this or the entree version with shrimp Service t too bad after the wait No getting water filled and it s nice getting souvenir for keepsake Overall I would recommend this place if you have a special occasion as the are incredible but don t expect amazing food Not bad for the price thoughGreat view service and margarita however the cheese were As a cheese I can t say that the here are authentic You must experience The Oasis not necessarily for the food but for its location above Lake Travis as a unique locale where you can spend an afternoon at the lake without being on the lake beauty is from this vantage pointAtmosphere the level deck idea Food t have any star View A Came here after a day of jet skiing on the lake I the food t spectacular so we ate first at the Iguana The sunset view was amazing Margarita s tasted fine but had booze in them I t mind the weak drink so much as the fact that they for such a weak drink which is robbery in I guess you do end up paying for that view one way or another It s hard to complain though when you have great company fresh air a view and friendly serviceIf you decide to go to the Oasis make sure you are going for the right For example you have some out of town and you want to show them that amazing view of Lake Travis DO NOT go there if you want great service cheap and or good food or strong As you will find none of these at Oasis That pretty much the place up want to pay a lot for a bad meal so you can sit and see one of in well then the Oasis is your place to beThis is an ideal place to sit on a balcony with and enjoy a cocktail especially at sunset when the view is spectacular The place is right on the lip of Lake Travis with the right angle for the sunset On the other hand the food is just The were good but the brisket sandwich was a little fatty and just middle of the road Still a great place toCompany in town so it s the obligatory trip to the Oasis for the sunset Sitting here waiting for the band to start The one poor guy at the bar is overrun there is a minute wait in line for The are around him even more The frozen drink machine is broken and it s impossible for him to make anything usable He is still smiling but losing the battle as the line longer by the second Just watched a guy pay for two frozen He was grimacing as the were handed to him it s kind of sad because the band just and this place could be run so much better No charge to get in so they are supposed to make their money on the but they forgot to hire enough to sell them This place could be run so much betterI keep this short and sweet We went for dinner so it was perfect for the sunset experience Weather was great sunset was great atmosphere was nice I d prefer a healthy from P Terry s for less than half the cost In other the food is and expensive for what you get Go for the sunset not the food Oh and their mist pelt you in the eye with water every rotation if you re not carefulabout the Oasis from a family friend so decided to check it out one weekend First off getting to the Oasis was a pain Since the restaurant is situated on a cliff there were so many and and tight to get there and many of the on the opposite side were coming over the line driving crazy around there Once we got to the restaurant I thought the atmosphere was great it was perfect weather and the environment was lively full of people On this particular night there were about separate so we about and for a table In the mean time we had around and watched the sunset on the lake Once seated we t have the best waiter he only attention to one particular table that ordered a lot of and the rest of his tables he d stop by maybe times depending on what you for I had beef rice and and my had the chicken and beef You also get an Oasis souvenir cup The food was I had better food in San but I think you just come to The Oasis for the atmosphere and view of Lake Travis EnjoyA friend this place for the view but not the food so we any food The were fine about each so with tip and tax around We came around on a so there was no wait and a close table to the edge Yes it is super touristy but if you t going to spend other time on the lake I would recommend that you make the trip out thereI t like the food here but the view is awesome We had some garden n chips n It Lake Travis and the sunset view is beautiful The restaurant itself is beautifully decoratedMy family I drove all the way from yesterday to try this place out It was I had already read the previous so I t too excited to try the on the menu U stuck with a cup of soup which was I better at home Also It was and very foggy so we t get a really nice view of the lake But I did love the fireplace on the insideGreat and Food t worth it If you go to he oasis just go for and an to watch the sunsetThe main attraction is the view particularly the sunset I was told by a local that the food was mediocre and they were correct Before going check what time sunset is for that day I also think they post it on their and be sure to either reserve an outside table or get there early Staff was young and somewhat apathetic However our server was awesome His name was very affable and funnyHave not been to the Oasis in This place a lot since the after the fire The view is what you go for and obviously not the food I however was pleasantly with the food we ordered I never it before but it gotten much better and a couple of the were just outright great We brought family there and they it We had a really sweet server and she was on the ball despite the huge distance she had to travel to serve us This is not a cheap place especially if you plan on drinking I plan on going back and out ofLet s be honest The food It s below average I had a few that t great The mixed t anything special either BUT the view is beautiful And for that reason alone it s a place we take out of Plus there is always ample seating and sometimes good The last two times we went the two different who on us t very good I do love the multiple level and the feel of the place though I only go back for We d consider getting married here and have someone else cater but it s expensive Turns out a good view is one of the that up the of a wedding venue faster than anything elseLike most people the food is just but the view up for it I have in town especially from out of state I will definitely take them to the Oasis to prove that can be beautiful With that said the food definitely t terrible and you get enough to eat I never had a problem with the staff and now that they expanded I can t remember the last time I had to wait long Bring your here they won t be disappointedFood was good View was great Service was horrible Had a party of Two t get made took forever Three times a runner brought food to our table that was not for our table They could have sold us a lot more in if they would have turned the around in less thanThe view it WAY better than the food and as I been told by many I agree with that statement It s worth going at least once for the sunset It s definitely an experienceI m here to the state of for such gorgeous and to the Oasis for taking advantage of that fact That said the food is only not awful but nothing to write home about and I agree with who noted the service can be slow especially on when they are super crowded I will definitely be back to enjoy the view but if you re looking for a fantastic meal this is not the spot I would also recommend it on weekend when the place is you could easily wait over an hour for a table just to end up eating one table away from a pack of screaming Personal note The screaming part t the fault of The Oasis specifically I am just always that person who up next to them in and on However for a weekend dinner I would rather look for a more free environmentThe are great and the restaurant a great feel The food is not that great and could be better seasoned Overall I would go again for the and to maybe just eatAmazing sunset The food is nothing special We tried a few different the shrimp was my favorite We had chicken and beef the chicken was a bit bland and the beef was a little better out service was good up until the time of payment our waitress brought our back and informed us that All she now was a tip I suppose she assumed because we were that we t Know enough to tip It was very tacky rude and unprofessional It really put a damper on a pleasant eveningI really really want this place to be better than it is The are just spectacular and the ambience is great BUT the food is The are weak Our server forgot like water ketchup and extra and we had to remind him to get those I don t even really remember what I ate the food was that forgettable It s a shame because this place could KILL it if they would up the flavor and make better is such a town that it like it would be a priority to have an amazing menu The drive is far but would be worth it if the food were better If you want to experience a beautiful view this place is great If you re for good food go elsewhereit was I only went to place just to say i went to it For my meal i ordered the fruit salad I forget what its but it had EVERYTHING U CAN NAME one of the best i have ever had in the that been living A very busy place and beautiful view Great for or a romantic night looking at the viewSo the food t very good We had which was lack luster I got a that was rough and came with sweet potato that had this weird red sauce The service was good And somehow by the grace of god they had With all that said I would actually recommend going because the view is AWESOME Just get drunk enough to deal with the foodThe food is decent but not exceptional but on a nice day or evening the scenery is unbeatable I had shrimp which was good The side salad was not good Good chips and Several good and to pick from This place burned to the ground around but the new facility is very nice with three to dine looking over Lake Travis and the Hill CountryThe Oasis was the it was so amazing with the of Love so cool However we went early on a and I was told that they brunch when I but they DO NOT It was food that was just with that view it should of been amazing to match It s in a very secluded area with a winding road to get there I hope they offer more on the menu and don t get so complacent with the food because of the beautifulIf a restaurant main attraction is the view you know that everything else may fall short In this case it s not all bad after all a drink with a beautiful view is never bad However be ready to wait for a table I around I was given an table but after waiting so long I was better The are good and strong and that is why I m giving them The service is but they are really busy so a bit rushed I did not try the food Based on other and what I saw in the restaurant it t anything better than what you would get at elthe food and the view Service was good help but notice that the plastic tables under the could use a good steam cleaning or a scrub because they are looking pretty tired andCame here for dinner on the deck Chicken was mediocre Carpet walking out to the deck needs to be This is an tourist spot The only thing keeping this place together is the alcohol and the viewwhere to start with this place I guess I get the good out of the way first Best part of the Oasis is the view But what else is new right Sitting atop that hill looking over the lake and a sunset and cheering along w the in appreciation is something to behold in However the hard part I experienced is timing in to making sure you have a table at the right time The couple times I been I always get the sense that I m being rushed by the to eat and get on out so they can sit their next table And I think thats a huge turn off because considering the location the last thing I want to feel is rushed while eating Then there is the menu selection One would think that as as The Oasis is they would expand on their menu It just very limited in my opinion Last time I was there I made the joke that I had more menu at and a girl at a table next to me over and agreed And yes some as well as I may say their are a bit steep for such common food but I know realistically I m not paying for the food I m paying for the value of real estate my seat is taking up on the hill But as a wise voice once said from a cornfield If You Build It They Will Come And sure enough they are Now I can t comment on the here but I had some go on a couple of during slow busy times and said that were either watered down or were of an alcohol spirit So ya there ya have itThis is one of those Yelp where it s tough to be original so you quit if you re redundant Great s Hula Hut s quality food aka very average Fairly bland Fun people watchinggreat service less than spectacular food beer selection is quite limited and left a lot to be desired was good but mint should be crushed our party of all agreed the food was bad enough we d consider not coming back despite the amazing of Lake Travis fairly good but significantly sandwich was way too fatty and the sauce was just bad it t take a lot to make this a great restaurant with the amazing and great service you just need to improve the food quality and improve your beer selectionAtmosphere was great that said food is below average Margarita tasted like and service was just For the price they charge for the food no matter the view it disappointed us Uncle Billy s might be a better choiceThis place is just gorgeous The especially at sunset are astounding I wish the food was just as great It is average You can get a decent or dinner The are a bit steep for the quality of food but the view it worth it The service is pretty mediocre as well It hot in and they are slow with I know they are busy but sometimes I feel like there are just not enough I want to give the restaurant a for the alone but the rest of the place is not worth it There is a bar upstairs which is great for and live music This is good not just got but for as well The Oasis could be amazing but they are on the fact that their view is beautifulI the food here is terrible However my mother told me I HAD to go and at least get a drink So we did just that I had a strawberry margarita and the with cinnamon ice cream with my Both were good The view is very nice even though the lake like someone the plug and is it drain awayThe view is fantastic but the food is mediocre at best The steak was excellent but the shrimp was in strong sauce and was made that way not worth If going make it there before to get a seat and see the sunsetIf I could rate just on the beauty of place Lake Travis I would give it Unfortunately other play into the scoring system It s beautiful here The and most importantly the view when sitting on the outside patio The lake from the reflection of the sun It truly your breath away and is a must see if you have never been The restaurant itself mediocre food and the service forever If you don t know what you want the server will leave you to decide for more than It was a good thing I had great company to pass the time along and they you yummy chips and We the and it just tasted like spicy cheese Not impressive It also made me very flatulent sorry for the which cheap in my body Another reason for a fall in a star is the lack of tequila selection The only tequila they have is It s a great tequila but that s the ONLY tequila Do come here when you have to show them the beautiful view of Lake Travis and to get drunk off Do not come for the food or serviceI went here for a nice date evening The restaurant shop area and of course the are remarkable The location of our table easily made the higher for not the best food worth it Good service long tasty red fish with butter sauce and no onion Still the venue for an unforgettable experienceThe scenery and music are enough for me to give the rating I did Beautiful restaurant great music and just so fun The Rock band was cool and sang s it You should not visit without visiting this place I t eat there so I can t rate the food but in any case just go for and dance your heart outDon t come here for the food come for the sunset Any other time during the day is not worth it By the way this restaurant a capacity of people It s stunning how huge it isThe food was good and the gift shop really cute stuff but the service was Our original waitress had a funky attitude We ended up moving to a different section and was a great waitress I the and the and the bean and cheese as I also had cheese that were good The perfect margarita was also a hitThis is a tourist spot because the restaurant on top of the cliff and they have three where tables are set facing the awesome view of the lake Food t that great and so you are paying for the location The area itself dead as many closed down due to no business Checked off the list as a spot where many people to seeThis place had a bunch of running around but their damn service was average every time our waiter by we t get chip or drink but hey it was a lit time with the squadI am giving this place based on the location and view alone Their food is not good Some of their are just and are just plain bad However you can t beat that view of the lake and the great location of their restaurant This is the type of place to go for a romantic evening but eat before you leave home and stick to the bar hereSkip the food and grab a drink outside and watch the sunset It is the best thing on the menu In fact the t that good either The three are only for the view which is worth itI came here as an out of towner brought here by an in towner who me to see the view Which was beautiful And being from San where we see water and beautiful all the time the view at the Oasis was still great I think most with water tend to suck on the food level and The Oasis was no exception It was not good And Our service however was good and you really can t mess up a Dos with a water view I don t know much yet about but it The Oasis is a tourist trap I imagine there are other with nice lake that have better food and t quite so When I find it most likely through Yelp I let you all knowIf your new to the area or have visiting this is a must do on your list Not for the food not for the incredibly view not for the amazing sunset but for the entire package It s fun The food is not to die for so order some and a few and enjoy the people your with It s the you build that matter anyway The gift shop was unique and reasonable for a touristy locale The restaurant is selling half priced green Oasis t shirt for the month of March There s lots of parking and the place is family The were pleasant and accommodating View Service Food and company pricelessOne of the best in Definitely a must see The food here is highly priced and mediocre but that s it s worth it for the Alternatively you can go there just to grab a desert after dinner and catch the sunset or check out the live that play there on most nightsI checked this place out twice and had similar so I figured now is the time to write a review so first off DANG THIS PLACE IS HUGE now that that s off my chest The Oasis is in the beautiful of with scenery like nothing I seen anywhere else since moving here it s gorgeous The building itself is massive and and stuff galore I only been here for lunch and dinner so I haven t all of the other stuff this place to offer but there s a lot The is fun and funky Definitely right up my alley with the art of random and the eclectic furniture carefully strewn about the place So high for the and On to the service not bad but not good I d say the service is The staff is friendly and alert but it s a bit inconsistent and like a box of you never know what you re going to get Your waitress may be attentive one visit and have her in the next odd Now the food the chips and I quite a bit The I ordered for lunch with black also not bad but the dang lettuce chicken I had for dinner man don t do it Bland dry chicken nothing special about it at all So low for the food and service Overall The Oasis is definitely a place worth so I will be back to explore all of the other stuff they have to offerThe view is amazing The food is good The chicken were perfect Black was too The was good but the chips were stale Love the regular chips and the Medium spice The grilled chicken salad was good But the view It is worth the view Several above the lake great for sunsetView is amazing food is The chicken appetizer was delicious Fun atmosphere with live music Family friendly with was greatStopped here for and after a day at the Lake Spa based on a recommendation The staff was young and somewhat stuck up We ordered our which they in plastic Made me feel like I was at a college frat party Then we ordered but half the container was out with lettuce kind of odd Anyways the killer was the or so bees that kept landing on our food forcing us to leave about after sitting down The staff t very helpful in dealing with the bee situation and simply gave us the check when we and so we left The are amazing though we were there on a cloudy day with rain in the forecast and Lake Travis still amazing I doubt I d go back even if I lived in the area but it s worth a visit for the viewThe and view was amazing The wait was pretty long and the food was Must come for the sunsetWe did love the view Margarita was really good We had Perfect Margarita and mango margarita I to try guava but they were out Chips and chile con were good and fresh I decided to go with the pecan chicken salad just because I thought there was no way they could screw up a salad until I had to wait until everyone else finished their food for the server to bring me a side of olive oil for my salad Service was super slow Between our family we had shrimp enchilada and Food were not that good You definitely pay for the location here I would go back for the margarita chips and just chill and watch the sunsetThe confusion delay w the hostess her temp staff of several young inexperienced was painful baby were taken to a person table in a crowded bar The request for another table was met w more confusion delay we finally just found our own table Food t brought out all at once but rather as each dish was ready Only were provided had to request a knife for my chicken This is a fun place great very good food Needs to get their s t togetherGreat location on Lake Travis The food is so so which is why it There are now better food nearby are reasonable and the are great Must be there for sunsetGreat and decent food Not worth driving to from but if you are in the area it s not a bad choiceThe Oasis is great for a lazy when you want to sit on a patio and have a few which is exactly why we went I agree with pretty much everyone else I could do without the food I got a salad soup which you can t really screw up The are with some orange goo turns out it s a cool whip concoction The service was terrible I think our server was a over day He definitely and like he would rather be anywhere rather than serving mediocre food with he view is definitely amazing I would probably go back just for the viewThe great view is at the expense of great service and foodCome here for the view not the food The view is amazing the lake is beautiful The food is the are great Seriously just come to drink and look at the lakeCame here easter weekend and that was a huge mistake The wait was Thankfully we were able to walk around the area take and enjoy the nice view After an hour we received a text saying that our table was ready We sat down and about before the waiter we were there We ordered right away and it took another to get our food The food was horrible and cold With that being said the view is beautiful but unfortunately the food is bad as well as the serviceThe of the lake were great The service was a little slow and they initially up part of the order The food was Had a live band and dance floor on the floor which was very entertainingI this restaurant the day after my best friend s wedding back in Let me start out by saying like everyone else that the location is exceptional because of its view out over Lake Travis and the ability to watch the sun set past the on the end of the lake The food was and in my opinion I had shrimp They were decent but they were WAY over with a heavily sauce I m a person who actually really but this was too much Eventually I ended up apart my taking out the scraping most of the sauce off and eating it piece by piece The worst thing about this place for me was that they pack way too many people into way too small of a space To even get to my table several people had to be to get up and move their so I could go by in my Same thing when I to visit the bathroom On the bright side the bathroom was entirely accessible Overall I m glad I went here but I m glad I t the one paying the check Come for the view and prepare to be disappointed by the foodCome for the view not the food This restaurant is very which it hard to review I could see someone a fancy group event here a romantic dinner here or just some gathering for lunch or dinner You will see dressed anywhere from to shorts and flip This it easy for anyone dressed in any way shape or form to stop in and dine The The view it s and can be seen from anywhere in the restaurant The choice to eat indoors or outdoors with the outdoors air or heat depending on the need The casual ness of the atmosphere if you re being casual The service always attentive The and experience surrounding the restaurant The parking garage along with valet if desired The The dining atmosphere if you re all fancy The food I never ordered anything that been memorable It s mediocre if that Walking up and around and down and through and dining to get to your table It s easy to get lost but it probably to be this way in order to share the view with everyone Long wait at very busy times They do not have any way of being notified when your table is ready so if you wander off into the gift shop and return to see you been over you may have to wait again I suggest to get the best experience to go casual during nice weather not the best food and mainly for the view Bring some and have a few glasses of wine You fit right in no matter whatIF ONLY they have better service and better food It would be a topnotch BUT apparently they t Food was Price is reasonable Service is a little slow View is wonderful though BUT I probably would rather go to the other around the area for better experience food and service with the same view I guess its just the I read the and I was not surprise why their are very low MAYBE they need to try something newAtmosphere Location View And that s pretty much where it This place probably THE BEST LOCATION in ALL OF So on the food Chips right out of a bag right out of a jar and it tasted like wait for it really bad tap water How does that even happen I just had some and with my beer but come on These are the If you can t get the right what you think I m going to drop on steak or Even the beer tasted weird And it was from a can Go with a group lower your on the food and enjoy the view and have a good timeTook here for and to watch the sunset over the lake THey have a wide selection of and The only food we ordered was chips and which was tasty The friendly young were great as long as you could get their attention This is a fun after work gathering placeand fun atmosphere but terrible food and service Can t make a skinny margarita seriously Not sure the server even the bartender if it was possibleThe food was not bad and the service was about average or a bit above But the view was fantastic and my and I had a fantastic time We would definitely go back for the view and the atmosphereSo agree with I give it for the view and atmosphere it provided x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x THE GOOD s x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x st Star Parking Plenty of them They even have cart to drive you from and to the restaurant and parking lot Star No line For the amount of and people who visit Oasis on a regular basis they always have place to sit you Star gorgeous Lake Travis view One of the most beautiful sunset I have ever seen x x x x x x x x x x x x THE BAD s x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x First Minus Star Food was below s average No one screwed up food as much as Oasis Minus Star Expensive food menu Shrimp Salad for Give me a break x x x x x x x x x x x x x x ADVICE x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x Go there for a drink sunset and maybe appetizer Don t waste your money on food Their parking lot is still under construction Kind of dusty Don t wear but if you do get off at the front of Oasis and ask your friend to park the car insteadthis place definitely t a great place to take a huge party It was however on one very nice evening a great place to take my for dinner Honestly the other are fairly spot on The food could be much better and the price for could be lower However the overall experience was enjoyable Our waiter was very cordial and I t feel like he rushed us along while we through sunset after finishing the meal The view was worth it and I have no going here Could I do better with a picnic and the bridge point off Yes But the whole point of going to a restaurant is to not have to Also this was quite the place to go for people watching My and I as much enjoyment from watching the other as we did watching the sunset Definitely t take someone who is mobility as the best deck are onlyYou come to The Oasis for the view The view is fantastic five The food is just My guy and I ordered the beef and chicken It was flavorful but not spectacular The food was within of and that a bit too quick for I will go back to enjoy the view and companyThe are beautiful the food not so much With as high as the are you just would expect a little better quality Steak was ordered medium rare but came out medium well Fish fell apart Nice place to visit but not because of the foodBeautiful view Good The food is not so good But with the view and you might forget or not care about the foodI agree with most and give for the beautiful of the lake and the sunset The service is bad and the food is awful I recommend eating somewhere before or after and coming here for a drink and viewfood for sub par taste The are good but that s about it Every time we make our way out there it is crowded and the wait time is just ridiculous Not worth sitting out in the humidity where service is not the best and the food is justMy list of patio dining would be remiss without The Oasis It s where we take everyone from out of town to show them a surprising side of It s without question one of the most gorgeous in the area and the patio is unbelievable because there are of with various all along a cliffside the lake The food is not the reason you re there it s just fine Not bad just not stellar Do order something and have a margarita and enjoy the sunset there is a tradition of ringing the bell when the last sliver of sun I love itMy company had a big dinner party thing here a while back I bet lots of do and I got to say I thought the view would be a typical over thing that actually monkey butt But it was absolutely phenomenal So amazing that I am actually on with the and paying for the god awful food myself To be fair it was edible It t horrible But their menu is so depressing virtually no whatsoever and what they have is completely unexciting and unoriginal Can somebody tell me what the dessert are here They re not on the menu and after waiting an hour to order and filling up on chips I had no room for dessert and the waitress when she told me what my were Now I m it cause I d like to skip the food and go the booze route when I come back By the way can t fault the service there were like of us so it sense that they were moving slow Since the company was the booze they had many many drink to fill before they could start us what we for dinner Love how their menu is actually bigger than their food menuWhen I first we were going here for our second team dinner I was a bit disappointed The yelp were not that great and all the we said that the food was not great However we t go here for the view mainly it was to enjoy the good and the great weather and for that it did deliver The were quite spectacular and it was great to sit out on the patio in perfect degree weather in the evening The food as was mediocre probably on par with a Chevy s We off with chips and all of which were I got to try fried avocado which is a local specialty I say it was worth trying at least once but not sure it s something I would get again Avocado just so great on its own don t think the coating and the really The I ordered for my entree were actually pretty good but at that point I was pretty full from all the chips The were just though I thought the one I had from San the previous day was a lot better Don t go here for the food but this is a great place to enjoy the sunset and warm weatherThe only good thing about this place is the view And I think that s sad because it already the view It obviously bad management and needs new with some knowledge of customer service If the t totally rude they just don t care about their job This place needs to be swept out and with good consistent to direct people where to go new new food music always more hustle and bustle I been here times and every time I walk in I m out by how dead and vacant this place is It just needs a little and it will be a huge money makeris one of my favorite in US The Oasis is on Lake Travis amazing view The food not so much Service t all that either Our server was working with other tables so we barely got any attention order was water came after food was There s lots of great in I d rather go to and come to Oasis to watch the sunset Maybe grab a drink thereFirst off I just want to say that this review is solely based off the amazing view that the Oasis Otherwise it would be a one or a two star Again as a repeat the view is AMAZING This probably one of the best sunset you can get The sun just over Lake Travis and you can get some quality from here Another bonus is that the drive out there is just amazing The and cliff sides provide an interesting back drop to how diverse is With that said the food is barely on par with what I would expect for and the are only so soGreat elevated view Lake Travis Decent food friendly service Nice deck that both shaded un shaded seating Fish were o k My had the and them Restaurant to be in a so I think you are paying a premium for the view and the neighborhooda beautiful sunset with great people Food was average A little Waiter could have used some red bull Food was cold when it came out The water and view are what you go for Great for a little romanceI wish I could give but I round up because I m nice Interesting place a lot to look at and see No wait at all for dinner just a short minute line Was seated on the inside but an edge of the deck table If you want one ask for a Rail side table and you get one according to our waitress Was the food t amazing but my friend and I were and we were with food Had better elsewhere but the view is incredible My friend and I did not feel like we were in but some exotic island oasis pun not intended Gorgeous view So in short eat elsewhere come here for dessert or The drive alone is long enough for your food to settle and you can get if you want And bring your camera if not you be taking on your cell phone and it won t be as cool as on I say it once more the view was beautifulThe view is Beautiful sunset The food normal and The waitress bad nothing exceptional You need to wait long I would like to come back just for the view another seasonWould I come here to satisfy a craving Nope There are that serve better quality food at I would take visiting here for the view and relaxed atmosphere or even if the husband and I want to have a getaway but for a meal Aside from that I commend The Oasis with three because of it s gorgeous location The food t horrible my table had shrimp fish beef and chicken but it t spectacular either The black left much to be desired but I assumed that was possibly due to them being vegetarian prepared read no pork or fat The rice was so so The next time I go I probably settle for some a and I do give props to our server for being extremely sweet and taking really good care of us She kept our iced filled and checked on us regularly If you get to sit in her section she s a doll We t rushed at all and ourselves in the glow of the setting sun and breeze coming off of the lake Do yourself a favor and don t have high in the gourmet category but do expect a great view good atmosphere on the patio and some leisure timeGood tasting food for the price Was in town for a baseball tournament The view of the lake was awesome and beautiful Popular local hangout atmosphere and by the lakedid I go on a good night or were my set so low by all the negative here Either way no real Well I do have a complaint about this whole lake level issue but the Oasis can t control that It was very busy and the service was than say a or something but it s more of a pace sort of restaurant don t you think You are there for the view and to visit with your not to gobble it all down and head out The were strong chips were fine the food I got the crunchy shrimp w was actually really good It was more expensive then what you might pay for that somewhere else but hey food in is expensive too Let s face it you ARE paying for the view and the experience and if you go there that you will be fine It s a great place for a special occasion or when you have out of town not your every random night out dinner sort of place Take it for what it is and you won t be disappointedCame here for a wedding I like that I t have to walk there in my tight ass skirt I was in a passenger covered golf cart from the parking lot When we got there I there were several to go through so one of the and basically told us to go up the to the second floor When we to the wedding room we there were blocking the doorway as if they t want people entering or through there Really Who does that At the Oasis Well we went style and it through there anyway I t eat at this event but the food t look good Nice view if you like dried upThis place an amazing view That it the three It s a beautiful atmosphere over the lake and you feel like you re in paradise What really it is the food seriously it s not that great When we got there the tables were dirty Staff is just standing around talking by the front The carpet like it t been in and the smell out into the lobby They need more to cover the kitchen it damp So to make it a quick reference The food is they need better but the view it worth it Being up there you forget the food Will return for the view but probably will stick to chips andat and were told there is a two hour wait Took cell phone number and was thus checked in What a scene This place is the melting pot of So many different sticks it was like world Sure in the last ten With two to kill we went to Vice for ice cream Strawberry cheesecake and soft serve were great I do a separate review but still relevant After ice cream we the perimeter looking for someplace to keep from being by the crowd had two teens with us so were not an option if you don t have there are a number of ways to kill two in the various Seated at the mark and Both were fine but the was certainly not the best I had Ordered food and two of four party s came out real fast My wife and mine still t out as I write this My wife just said I m not even hungry Will update in a bit Update weak with hunger Update Last two arrive after the first two Grilled shrimp were really good Chicken were also not bad Not as enjoyable since two of the four had finished their If you are going go for the scene and the sunset The food is average and the service was questionableThis place tried to change too much since it burnt down and was rebuilt I used to love going here but the food is The atmosphere is great and an awesome view of the lakeMove You re blocking OUR sunset That s basically what my dad said to a couple a special moment as the sun set behind Lake Travis They t know they were in OUR view They t mean to be so offensive as to stand between us and OUR sunset But they did And my dad to make sure as they knew it I said Dad hey it s They are here to enjoy the sunset too He said in a tone clearly audible by our sunset They probably don t speak anyway the To which my sister and fellow yelper said Yeah Dad but it s probably best to always assume they do The sun set People We finished our mediocre and mediocre The truth is we were only there for the sunset and when that turned into a near altercation it was time to leavePeople mainly come here for the view Some very nice The food is alright but you can definitely get better in almost any area of ESPECIALLY forThe Oasis on Lake Travis is very famous of beautiful view lake with sunset so perfect for romantic dinner However some can be rude as snob unless are very good Special for summer time always too and full of parking a lotThe Oasis on Lake Travis in is a huge three level restaurant with multiple lounge and shopping Parking is a large unpaved lot Ample indoor and outdoor seating so bring Variety of menu The westward view over Lake Travis is the real attraction Nice place to relax at a balcony table and enjoy the sunset overWhat to add here You really t be coming here for the food But the way everyone about it they make it sound like it s the worst food ever made in the universe I been here times I think in the last and I feel like they have a different cook each time The last time I was here the food t bad at all Just calm down people yes it s unjustly but there s no other place nearby with this view and atmosphere so factor that in The Red Fish was by my party The Grilled Shrimp s were but used a bit more shrimp I t eat solid food at the time so I tried the watermelon soup It was interesting but I t recommend it Last time the waitress was nice enough but very slow in filling out and throughout the evening and up on us Their are iffy and sometimes they stay open later if there are a lot of people so it t hurt to call and ask when they are and if there s a wait time Overall take your food and enjoy the view and atmosphere with good company You only be coming over here when you have out of state anywaystar for the food for the view and atmosphere Simply you are coming to this restaurant for the view not the food I can find bar food that better than what they have on their menu but getting dirty and a beer with this view it all worth it Despite the menu I will backreally Service was a bit over attentive actually I don t think I went more than a few without being if everything was acceptable but As was virtually everything on the menu Of course you are paying for the view such as it is with the droughtThe whole reason to go to the Oasis is for the Which are gorgeous and luckily can distract you from the mediocre food and quality The are hit or miss so it is better to stick with something that t have to be mixed It is a nice place for winding down after a day at the lake with a beautiful sunset and a glass of wineFabulous from the umbrella on every level good food is fair They are known for their and Great stop when visiting sunset capital of Touristy stopLike everyone is saying the food is but They told us we had a minute wait at so we got at the bar and we were to wander on the patio do we took The view is awesome We were seated at an outdoor table next to end of the drop after Our waiter was very attentive and got us chips and our in a reasonable amount of time Our food was it was edible and tasted I got the Brisket Sandwich because how could that be screwed up in but it was little meat and not enough taste seasoning just bland If the food was a little better I would have given since great view and customer serviceThis restaurant is up on a hill that I think Lake Travis The place is gigantic and can hold a lot of people There is a lot of dirt parking for all those that want to sit out on the patio to have a night There are two to this place If you get a chance you should get to the top level That way nothing will fall onto your head What do I mean We were sitting at our table and water fell on us Apparently some water was by up top Though how do we really know it was water and where was the free stuff Oh well I d also like to mention that we were seated in plain view of the owner s house It is a castle They could afford to make it up to us Anyway the food was not amazing but was sufficient for dinner There to be a full service bar and a lot of great There are also available for private and I imagine during the day this place is cooIf you re looking for a nice view this is the perfect place Food is eh I mean it s But had a lovely time enjoying the viewThe Oasis is as the A They get a for the view for service and for quality of food and taste The taste of everything I ordered was good but not great and was definitely for the quality However I don t have any The service was good and the food was fine overallFood is and service is mediocre are weak and expensive However the are star The wait is long but they have a million different to sit at and to visit so it the time quickly There to be no wait during the week The first time we went there we ordered the triple meat for one My and I split it and still had enough leftover for both of us to eat lunch the next day That was the only entree that is worth the priceIf you are looking to spend some good time enjoying the view drinking and eating appetizer I would say this is the place for you to go It s on the top hill with a nice view of lake Travis I am not sure why they have horrible food A nice place like this should think seriously about their entire menu and start serving some good foodBeautiful view and fun place to walk around but the food is mediocre and the service is worse We been on different and we never had good service The wait is long which is totally understandable It s a huge place and a lot of people visiting However the staff forever to come to your table and they are not friendly The food were wrong took forever to come and we were never on we had to flag other down to get and finally to get out bill It would be a great place if they at least had good serviceMan a couple of and I stopped here on our way to and like several say the view is awesome the food well We were given complimentary chips and which were tasty I had the spicy chicken sandwich on a hard pretzel bun Chicken was I really do like my poultry to be on the dry side why but I always prefer it but even this was too dry for me The bun was too hard likely a bit stale t even easy to cut in half with the dang steak knife However the were great They had a super crispy coating not in an way The sauce on my sandwich was good but the star chicken bun just fell short is too high for the quality of food So back to the restaurant itself Our table was dirty upon being seated hostess it down and we were then handed surprise Dirty And I don t mean dirty as in a few of food I mean had a gigantic smear of some sort of dip or sauce across the top Super gross There were also quite a few bees around I love the bees don t misunderstand I d never purposefully kill one either but it s VERY them fly all around you and your food while still to enjoy yourselves God forbid someone have a bee allergy I mean they were THAT badThe service is terrible The food was delicious but our waitress was every time we something I herd that s normal for them though Great location wonderful but the service was just terribleHave been here a handful of times and every time I come I say the same thing this place is amazing for but NOT for food Wish they would change up their food and make it better If you never been you have to come to catch the sunset over lake Travis Banana pina is very good but don t waste your money on the For sure come with plenty of time and don t be in a rush because this place is ALWAYS Check out the from the beer garden area too An must to visit just for the and atmosphere but again not for the foodThree as the view is great Stick to and and you will be fine The food is mediocre at best the are wonderful and chips are good although a bit too much and lettuce added asThe food is most of it was bland The were really good though I don t know if you could take the but It s a great souvenir The view is phenomenal but very chilly so take a light coatThe view is fantastic and so beautiful The food is and not worth the i had such a fun time enjoying the view and The view up for the lack of food Great environment overallWe came here for the view only We got there and for a table The table was about a minute wait We went outside to look at the river we got a drink during the wait However the food t great We got the for It t great The chicken was bland the were the t have any flavor We saw different complain to the manager The were better than the food If you re coming here because you want to eat good food this place t for you If you re stopping by for a beautiful view this is the placeWe The Oasis yesterday around It was crazy busy probably because it was a on a holiday weekend and we were a party of but anyway Staff super and From the person who checked us in to the girl who us to the table there was just a rushed and negative energy Despite the ladies we with initially our server was AMAZING I t get his name but I really wish I had My grandmother is sick and was visibly uncomfortable settling in and he made it a point to let her know that he would get her anything she It was such a kind gesture and only took a second on his part I really that He really busy and was still able to be attentive to us and make sure we had whatever we The food was good nothing out of this world It came out quick and everything was exactly how we it and all We were lucky enough to get a table the lake so we the view during lunch All in all I probably t go back too much We had a good waiter and that was the only reason this review The view is beautiful and the around the restaurant also add to the experience I had some coffee after lunch and it was amazingI use to this place every time I would visit it was a must But now the menu is horrible I hate that they took the spicy off the menu I literally got up and left when they told me they were no longer making them It s disappointing when there is something all of my group of want to go get and cannot You basically pay for the view Maybe they will decide to bring them back and our group can start going backGreat view but the food needs some work For example their chips and are bag chips with a ton of salt I like homemade chips that are warmThe location is gorgeous Looking out at Lake Travis especially at sundown no one can beat that Their food is It is not a place I would intentionally search out for food Also there are no or anything for outside dining which is a consideration for those withThe view is great but the food is If you re just going for the view enjoy the and along the same area There are plenty of other to catch the best sunset inI live five away and go about once every five Food is You take your from for the view but that s about itThe food is not the best really great view though nights are very fun lots of music to dance toThe view is what really this worth the drive if you re visiting the area It can get very crowded with long so I d try to go at a non meal time The food is pretty standard average fare I would recommend the chicken sandwich meal It can be on the side for what you get I think because they know people will come for the view no matter what I do like that you get a cup with the meal to remember the tripThis place t bad for food But the are where it s at A perfect summer spot for dinner especially at sunset the away from any A little for quality of food but that view is pretty phenomenal I would definitely go back for a drink and to watch the sunset over Lake Travis So worth itThe view is gorgeous and sunset The were This is a place you go to a out and enjoy the atmosphere We for a table We got inside around and the table was ready at We sat in a section at the very edge of the building where there was no light We had to shine our on our food because we were literally eating outside in the dark While we to sit outside we t know we would be sat so far away and there t be any light I was able to walk outside and get of the sunset from the patio while we were waiting for the table I sat at the bar the entire time other than when I went to take My sister and I had total and that was I would go back for the view and the chips and The food is just Very small menu and kind of all over the place I don t think it can even be considered but next time we will probably just have and chips andwas fantastic but nothing the incredible setting and view I d recommend theWaitress was great food was over priced Good tourist place and great scenery with mediocre foodAmazing food and service declined Long waiting time to be seated They should divide family area than adult area When you re going in a date or as couple is very annoying next table screaming or making a fit Please implement a zero areaI am honestly giving the Oasis for the view alone The food was not good at all Terrible really and I don t know how you can screw up I mean come on I think that my month old daughter could cook them The view is wonderful though and if you have someone in from out of town it is a great place to go have a few and enjoy the viewWent to check it out after hearing the location had a pretty view Some of my said the food was not worth the price so I went with low but the food turned out to be pretty good and the serving size was much bigger than It did have a good view and had a lot of near by to check out while we Pretty cool But the server took way too long to come around Overall service was slow and at the end we sat waiting for her to come around for about to pick up our check I understand that the restaurant is pretty busy popular but I d say min is too long for a server to check a customer out Other than that pretty good place to go for food and I would recommend going if you have never gone We got the and the pork they were both pretty goodOn a we to get there before the sunset around and were told it s an hour and a half wait We went upstairs to watch the sunset it was nice As soon as the sun went down I got a text message that our table was ready It only took There were a lot of empty dirty tables around us and a whole section no one inside Food was not spectacular Oasis to be in a chaotic state in of management our server was and it took her a long time to come back to take our order We drove from to come here is a city we would visit again but Oasis won t see me until they have something better going onGreat for the The food is not amazing It s always crowded and you can t make so it s always kind of a waiting situation It s a do it when you have guest kind of thing or a cross off the budget list but other then that you can t get the a little lower over at the in the Overall Quality of food is a Uniqueness Service Experience PriceThank you fellow I took your advice and did not go for the food We filled up on at Box and then took a scenic drive here for the awesome photo We had and a key lime pie and relaxed We got everything we out of this placeOur last night in we decided to check this place out We it had an amazing view This place t take and on a night the line was a wait to dine in Since we read the on yelp and saw the food t worth it we ate before coming here We around and took of the view We actually out on the bar and even though it was super hot we had a good time pool and watching the lake Other than that I don t see what all the is about this place It s alright just to go once or maybe during the fall winter that is not intolerable with the crazy heat like during summer timeBeautiful sunset food and are average for the quality of food If it s cold they wont let you sit outside it s a bummer to drive out there only be able to see through the window The food truly is not worth the price I had basic fish they were my husband had some small piece of baked chicken which was covered in too much cheese like vomit honestly that was we had basic our total bill was close to definitely for a view that we t even enjoy If you do go be best for summer were taken from through the windowSo I went to The Oasis from the recommendation of my so we went here with her family yesterday for the Fourth of I in advance to check on their availability they don t take so just precaution When we there there was a shuttle available so that s a nice plus They was no wait and we actually got seated within Now the breakdown Location The view is amazing I been to before for boating and this was actually one of the best of Lake Travis Facility A lot of outdoor seating with included for those who hate the sun beaming down also are there with light water blowing so that was nice as well A real downside is the downstairs The men s was poorly and trash was filled with a ton of paper Overall Food Reading previous I would have to say I cannot argue The food here is I ordered the Shiner Bock Pork and I will say it s nothing special Pork did not seem as moist and almost a little bland Chips and were average at best I also for what is available on local draft and they only That is not a very broad selection On top of all this the food here is way for I get the experience value but On the Border and other are and offer better food Overall Service Our waiter was nice in the beginning but I don t feel he was really engaged He forgot to give us water at times and took almost to get a to go box He to be going through the Side note Even the staff photographer t seem that to ask to take a picture Maybe they re more on top of their game when it s more crowded Random The gift shop stays open as long as the restaurant is open Don t pay attention to the stop by there anyway to make sure So this was my review ever If you re looking for a place with a great view this is a good place I do wish the overall experience Food facility service was similar to the was well Overall It may not average out correctly but oh well I would love to update this to a better rating next time I stop byThe main attraction is the view which is worth the visit The venue itself is also a bit of an attraction and can accommodate VERY large Almost all who come know in advance that the food is NOT the reason for coming It is not bad but it is also not great especially for the price are also good but not great and also not cheap This place is pretty popular despite somewhat lackluster service and unremarkable food because there is a certain enjoyable the lake I think the main reason people eat here is the lack of other in the area to do so I m glad I went but was quite disappointed with the service from start to finish and several people even more than the food which I had been about It s not even necessary to order anything just to come look around so perhaps either just doing that or maybe just a drink might be a better idea than coming for a meal at least until they improve both their service and quality of food for its priceIf you want a great view while you are eating then this is the place The food could totally have been better You are totally paying for the view High so so foodVery crowded Mediocre food but great The best part is the view Great place to go if your new to I recommend going at sunsetGreat view but the food is and I guess you pay extra for the viewCame here because have how beautiful the view is but the food t extraordinary The atmosphere is super cute and we sat outside for the view It was about but we sat next to the heater so it t too bad I ordered the fish I t take a pic and my friend ordered a regular The fish were mediocre and I t really find them super My friend said the was alright as well I came here for the view not so much for the food View beautiful Food nothing specialWorth going to for the amazing view Food is not bad but not memorable Had the Sipper which was the perfect drink for a spring eveningIf you re looking for a place with a killer view of the lake this place is perfect I d give the view and The food a The food and service are not very good in fact rather disappointing We have been there times and tried various on the menu We have yet to find a menu item worth for so when we do come for the view we stick to andCame for the view The service is not great Had the chicken and there was nothing special about them I do recall them being over priced If I could do it over again I would strictly have and skip dinnerView was great food was marginal at best Long drive to watch the sun set and pay a premium price for a that I t eat were good but I don t think we be backWay I don t understand why this place is so popular It must be the scenery because the food was at best Not worth the ride or waitThe are great and so are the hurricane but the sit down service was slow and the food was justI came here not too much based on the I seen here but since it was my first time and I m been itching to see Lake Travis had to give it a try for myself The outcome Food is just but the view is killer And I do love the fact that while you re waiting for your table there are waiting on the patio so might as well take advantage of the time and take your of the amazing view andThe view is The food is mediocre The service is with a smile but can be insanely slow As in it took over an hour after we ordered to get our meal on this last visit Which is cool if you are enjoying the star view but it was sunny and super windy After nearly being by an umbrella that flew up from the floor below us and next to us they took all the down So we sat in the hot sun for an hour waiting for our food Not just us but the or so other tables in our section All of us hot and Without us even saying anything though the manager actually our significantly so that the sting Net net go for the view but know that you may spend a fair amount of time waiting for your food Not to mention there is usually a wait to get seated So while you may plan to go for brunch it may end up being Which may work out as they have really prettyBeautiful view Gorgeous sunset The food on the other hand I ordered the cheese thought how can anyone not know how to prepare yeah won t be those again I just have their cocktail next time for the view and for their foodFood was alright nothing phenomenal were decent not super expensive Service was great but a little slow at times since the restaurant was so massive The view was spectacular and outside made it bearableThis was my first visit at Oasis and were told the current wait time was which appropriate for a busy The wait time ended up being about The view from our table t great because we were seated at the back to the building even though there were plenty of empty tables The food was not bad but not delicious The plate for had the same amount of meat as the plate for There was a limited menu due to Covid It was a good experience but not sure if I be backWell sometimes you really do pay a pretty price to enjoy the beautiful view of Lake Travis I been to The OASIS multiple times The food is disappointing and nothing special On a normal basis it the tendency to be busy I remember the service was slow a few times I went but it s understandable when the restaurant is so The view on the other hand absolutely amazing I probably will return to The OASIS because of the stunning view the restaurant The drive there to be quite pleasant scenic as well If you are looking for a pleasant view of Lake Travis while eating I would recommend The OASISservice It off good and then its The view is great so if you wish to go don t expect A dining experience you can totally enjoy the sceneI finally this place with one of my It is a long drive so it took some effort Luckily we got there than the huge crush We got an awesome table At first our waiter was great He was attentive and responsive Then it that he got and it would be between check in The view is an absolute five star dream It is beautiful The and stuff everywhere is and fun You could spend just walking around out the grounds The food leaves a lot to be desired The was tasty with good consistency The chips were great The were I would recommend a visit if you re in for a whileThe view is stunning and sadly that s where its Food was average I ordered the fish and it soggy Service was good and attentive our server was knowledgeable and friendly Overall I would not rush back other than to sow to the great n dip only next timeThe view was amazing which made up for the mediocrity of everything else The furniture on the deck was just not the best of quality and a lot of it t match The deck so much potential and is not living up to it Much more by the of the tap house next door on the top floor and the food better too The service was very probably because we got sat a pretty big distance from the restaurant the outside area is hugeBasic The menu and were fine but not amazing Our service was fine The however are gorgeous Regardless the rest is not unique The fish were than The any significant flavorDon t expect good food we have been there countless times and the food is sometimes horrid But the spicy chicken are good and the are decent Obviously great viewFor a first time visit for my father n law th birthday will have to say it was The view was amazing although the service was alright The did not come out sizzling hot for which I was disappointed that me and my wife split I order chips and which took a while to come out We also ordered the banana pina which I know there was not fresh mixed into the drink Being a bartender I could tell there was no in there Very disappointed Order a cheese for a child and came out with the wrong sides with it and the fact you charge to for a chicken Pretty ridiculous Also another child at the table ordered chicken and you get two of them for to I work at a fine dining establishment and we offer chicken with a side for Oh also if you have a party of or more Please let them know that gratuity is also included Being part of the industry I would have tipped more if gratuity was included Most likely will not come back hereThis place is beautiful outside watching the sunset great place to go But the food t all that great I would consider just order somewhere else n have n watch the sun go down there that s all Otherwise great serviceCome for the view Order something that s hard to be disappointed by like or a basic The food is mediocre at best and definitely But that view though It s kept me coming back every time someone and to seeThe for the Oasis are so mixed and I m not helping to clear up the confusion There are so many good and bad about this place that it s hard to decide what to rate it The food The view when there s water The service hit or miss The ambience tourist trappy but fun While the place its it s also a Travis County staple that you have to go see At least once and a good time await youMinimal menu maximum The and surroundings are outstanding The food and service was Definitely need to visit as part of Lake Travis experienceThe location scenery is beautiful But the food and service not so much I was really excited to take my family there I mean we did drive to come here for lunch in and saw hostess just standing there I was not with a smile or a loud Hi Welcome to The Oasis Only one girl said Hi How many while the rest just stood there It was just awkward The hostess are the very first people you come across when entering a restaurant First are everything Anyways we were seated quickly and we re brought out with complimentary chips and which was nice We ordered our which did come out min after the order which was awesome I had the Southwest Chicken Salad Stuffed Avocado which I would definitely NOT recommend The chicken is up like dog food and can tell the meat is not made fresh I did not enjoy the meal what so ever I removed one star because the service and another for the food On our way out we decided to check out the gift shop was not what so ever either The female working just had her back turned around just folding apparel Overall the location is beautiful My mother her frozen margarita and our server was super sweet I believe her name was or Would not come back unless they the menu with fresh meat and worked on customer serviceThe Oasis is best summed up as It s not bad it s not great it somewhere between and a little alright That t to stay the staff t friendly or competent they are but here is the issue The food is pretty and the service is either good or very very spotty It would be more upsetting if it were not for the phenomenal view of Lake Travis and the beautiful of the restaurant The waiting staff are all very clearly young and fresh to serving and it s clear of their uncertainty when they are taking and how they greet their I know what it s like to be young and serving so I hesitate and feel bad in saying a lot of the stem from them Beautiful view Beautiful restaurant Nice shopping in the center that it The price for your food and is Often a long wait Food is just are sometimes wrong It is clear at time the serving staff is confused It d be easy to say make better food or train your staff for high I know it more than that So for the view and the you make with your it s three I always recommend people visiting to go there for the view it up like this Go to the Oasis the food is just and the wait is sometimes pretty long but the view is amazingWe went there for some and which were I felt this place is for it s amazing view The wait time for our party of was somewhere around for a evening We to sit outside for the view But the August heat was too hot to handle However the view is greatView is great When sun is not blinding you great spot and good service Food is a bit bland and not much to choose fromYear after year I have taken to The Oasis because of the view Sadly the only thing The Oasis going for it is location location location Last night our server had too many tables Saying she was and scatterbrained is an understatement t this before but the food is made so you cannot One person in my party about and was told we can t do that all times There were in our party came out about before the that for an awkward situation at the table Let s be honest you go to The Oasis for the view time in I gone and the wait for an outside table was so we to sit indoors however there were entire of outdoor seating unused and closed off Why can t sit in those outdoor Food was at best our server was a robot just trying to keep up with all her tables It was a disappointing experience and won t be going back It s just not worth the drive The only reason I gave was because of the beautiful lush garden in front of entrance the incredible the lake and sunset view I REALLY wish this restaurant would get their stuff together but I suspect it won t ever happen considering how long theses exact same have been coming in So much lost potentialOne of my favorite in you can tell as soon you arrive to the spot is Is worth visiting to shop and take because of the view The are on point Don t be afraid to order what you like as far as go alcohol you won t be disappointed One thing I don t recommend is the food The food short to the amazing place they have here I dislike the food and the wait time Just go prepare to wait in line and to get you a table for min I hope to came bacK to better food quality next timeThis is a place you come to enjoy the I love it specifically for that purpose only I been that the food t great here and that may be true We t pay much attention to that because we were trying to enjoy ourselves The waitress was friendly however should pay closer attention to where they place the food and how easily accessible it is for the customer to reach for them Both my SO I had to get up from our to retrieve our food after the waitress it there and we actually had to ask for chips and which is usually provided I thought The mixed was the safe choice as I had them before but the rice and were not good at all The bloody was Again a safe choice all pictured If you decide to visit this place please be advised and go in knowing you re paying for the experience and not the foodBeautiful scenery The Oasis beautiful all around the lake There are and a bar area around the place which is great to check out while waiting for your table The wait is pretty long but that s to and hour the least The food is average Not much of a selection and a little They have an area for live music as well The around are cute with the love on them for display Probably t go there again for the food but definitely a drink and the sceneryWhat a place This behemoth of a restaurant is really something to experience It was a very hot and humid evening Service was very fast and moderately efficient I had the combination steak and chicken It was terrific Very tender steak and chicken well seasoned the quantity of meat I have ever had with a terrific flavor Just a few which was kind of odd But very tasty Lots of chips and a very good The view was spectacular as it this place a real destination are a little high but the view is spectacular from the It s a place you go to from time to time for the experience were not so inviting They could work on that part of it of people must roll through this place every week I can t imagine what it would be like on a holiday or a weekend I would avoid going for sure Some of my family had to wait about a half an hour just to get their name in and then wait another for a table on a very busy weekend It s almost like a theme parkIf you re a tourist go here If you re a local like I am you know to stay away during busy times basically every night during summer The food here is not good but the view is niceThe view is the best in the city It s ridiculously crowded on the like You don t go here for the food Could use a good scrub The volume of people that go through this place me wonder how clean the place could be You go here for the viewI put up with a lot for a great view This is one of the best panoramic I ever seen thus I the touristy tacky atmosphere and I what draft beer they had and was told None None add incredulity here No they don t want to haul up three Dude you got an elevator That s what they tell us I d toss in another star maybe if they had some decent draft beer Cuisine wise I d put up with a trough of baked garnished with a couple of dead as long as it comes with that viewGreat of Lake Travis We came here at sunset and it s definitely worth it for a picture or two and a drink The food is to be desired I would compare it to Chili s like they have a lot of around it that we t get a chance to check out Ice cream shop breweryFood is just average but I don t think anyone comes here for the food This restaurant is along lake Travis and one of the most spectacular of the water and sunset which is why most people visit If you are in for a day would highly recommend going here for sunset and enjoying it the lake It almost you the of being on the coast Food otherwise is average typical food chicken fish but the view is EnjoyI had my wedding at The Oasis and is was CLOSE to perfect Beth was phenomenal through the whole process and I don t want this to disregard that AT ALL but a couple before the wedding I found out she would be at a bridal convention on the day of my wedding until or so She ended up those but it still made me feel like I was on the back burner I m your bride THAT DAY A convention comes second to me or send someone else Maybe management was sending her and if they were shame on them because THANK GOD she was there because it ended up storming during the time the ceremony was to go and she knew the right second to send me out for the perfect after the storm sunset It me when Beth left my reception and left some in charge and instead of discretely me which card to use for the bar tap they until we were ON THE BUS to go back to the hotel after our sparkler departure at midnight and came ONTO THE BUS and my dad off the bus to pay the tab unprofessional and just plain disrespectful The father of the bride and my new husband had to EXIT the bus walk back into the venue and pay the tab when they HAD MY CARD ON FILE people were wondering what was going on I was so embarrassed They need to hire people with a BRAIN if they re going to allow Beth to leave mid reception I hired for for the tables for could take I ordered ten and ended up with nine I KNOW no one from my small wedding would steal a camera I was looking back on the and there were of in the office proving that they were taking the into the office one photo attached I truly believe someone that worked there took it and maybe forgot to return it or plain stole it I had to pay for that camera Not cool at all Especially because I donated of my table to The Oasis This truly does not sit well with me in the bridal suite DOES NOT WORK Everyone was sweating day I knew this going in and maybe they should look into this in the future but the Groom s Suiteview for the sunset Have a drink but avoid the food which is too greasy On a band musicThe view Yes but the view I know it If nothing else the newly rebuilt Oasis an even BETTER view possibly from the top floor of the tiered terrace than it had previously Dang The night dancing this time provided by the Brew Those are alright The dance floor tho is just too damn small Not too damn small for anywhere but too small for a bar of this magnitude The Oasis can seat hammer way WAY more many than it previously could and it was pretty crowded even on a Get rid of some of those tables people Food same as before the fire eh WEIRD Giant check Still life of fruit check White wicker check stuff check Red style check check post modern on the check rustic hybrid pagoda with orange hourglass in it check Larva candy in the Oasis store yes really insect candy check Movie hanging on wall of the The Godfather Back to the Future Grease check sculpture you can sit in by the parking lot check Beware the single central pillar of the place on the terrace that is all ramshackle looking wood why is this pillar different from all the other stone AskThis place a great view over looking lake Travis but I think they need better just really t worth the price I mean if u want crapy food a great view then this the place for u I don t really complain about high price when food is good but this just wrong neat place to relax and have a cold one but that s as far as I would take it shameI feel like everyone that the food is fine and the view is incredible right If you go in knowing this your visit will be much smoother I think The service is also hit or miss wrong but the staff is generally friendly I personally like going for and and quality time with my while the beauty of I also enjoy looking at all of the unusual the grounds It s definitely a place to bring family if you want to impress them with pretty I just always mention beforehand that the food is mediocreThe view was amazing and service was great but the food taste could use an improvementI been to the oasis multiple times and the BEST thing about it is definitely the view It s gorgeous at any time of the day but the sunset is As for the food it s fine but don t expect to anything special I know many complain about the but most of them are part time who are only working temporarily so don t get with them they re usually newGreat view on the lake Amazing location with sunset All other were closed was More would have been nice Server gave us time to talk The heat a lot after the sun went down were tasty We d go backCome for the and the Find somewhere else to eat before or after Our appetizer came out still frozen The the were fantastic The wait staff is very attentive It s a great place to hangout overGreat view of Sunset It really IS the sunset capital of All else is mediocre A trap anywayView is gorgeous Food i e chips gross and Place is tacky yet endearingis known for great and so if you re going for the food you probably be a bit disappointed I kept it simple and ordered beef The taste and texture t really there and I t bother taking home any The service was extremely slow but we t mind it too much since we were visiting and were headed back to our hotel after dinner We with plenty of daytime left to enjoy the natural light and the complete sunset and of nature Now the view is totally worth itBeautiful view We had a table right along of the edge of the deck We as soon as they am and we were seated immediately Blanca was our waitress She was friendly and checked on us frequently throughout the meal I read some horror about the wait staff so it was refreshing to have a nice host that seated us where we and an attentive waitress We definitely be back for the when we have come in from out of town The fire chicken were yummy The shrimp not so much Food is for what you getIn summary come for the stay for the maybe have a margarita make other dinner Its best to come a while before sunset before the crowd in and lock down a table I stick with chips and maybe the occasional or Unfortunately the food here is but the view itself three Service is good and they understand why people are going there so they respect whatever you re feelingMy family and I came here post I ordered steak I what temp they came our server said medium or at least that s what we there may have been a from the mask I presume It came well done I had them take it back by the time my food came out again my whole family s food was gone everyone s ready for the check were two in to being there were missing our appointment for I told them to just do it rare to make sure it s not again When it comes many on it are rare and I mean raw rare Also I only had to bat off a good ten on my now cold and I just said forget it I will get it to go It s not my fault she clearly t cook my food I m just highly upset to have wasted money on food I t eat and I have to take back to my hotel to heat up so that I m not eating cold raw food Let s be honest I m not eating this food it s surely going in the garbage I been on mommy duty all day with my family for two finally had a chance to sit and have a real meal with my family who not seen me since my baby shower and I m sitting there hungry food for so long Now we re rushing to this Not to miss it meanwhile I still have not eaten is a star for sure Friendliness of the staff a star And the are actually good I got to taste but for as long as I I should have ordered a few What would have made this better is simple they should have kept the food and taken it off the bill I felt like they were more worried about the then the customer experience They could have some fresh rice and instead of the fly ridden that set in front of me for so long I really to like this place My husband his food and This is my place when heIf you want the best view of the sunset then this is the place and the overall view is probably the best in The they have maybe limited but the they do make is very solid especially with the frozen Food but still borderline edible at best If you like to listen and or dance and have in the evening and nights then this could be the place for you Daytime hanging out t really what is cracked up to be as there are better to do that and it would be inconvenient to go out that far for something that is limited in quality If you plan on eating here stick with the because not even they can mess that up and if they do well then they t even serve food period Price is a bit high which t worth the service you get Overall I likeWonderful scenic dining Not much more you could ask for in Lake Travis Plenty of space decent food and Food can be a bit cold but just point it out and they should take care of youjust because of the view I have been here twice now for dinner and the first time was pretty good as far as service but I never thought the food was outstanding here and especially for the price The second time I came here for dinner I had an awful experience The service was absolutely terrible Order came out incorrectly and even after correcting them they brought it out incorrectly again Not the type of service I would hope for especially for a restaurant that is it better be for a good reason I thought the view was beautiful but other than that my food is way better and so I stick to that from now on unless I m going for a drink and a drink onlyCOVID review Let s make this simple and sweet Good service Great view and atmosphere food Way too hot to sit outside comfortably during the summer they do not have enough cooling Horrible for the quality and quantity of food you getThe view is great absolutely beautiful The hostess sat us down but we a view so we ask if we could get a different table and she was supposed to go ask but she ended up not coming back to us I ordered a but when I got it it came out dry no flavor meat was like it was extra well done were good our server was very friendly but at times our table felt like were getting forgotten aboutBeautiful place wonderful view Tried lettuce wrap chicken fire ball my son pizza Lettuce was bland chicken ball was my his pizza were decent service was good for place and view for foodWhich one of you my review again Yes I m sure I wrote one Still a tourist trap and always expect to wait an hour on any given weekend Here will be even now that a few neighboring have closed their What s that Do I smell a slow dying death like Highland Mall The surroundings are very cheery for the mood conscious people You can get a little therapy here and after you absorbed enough you get back in your vehicle drive down the steep winding for and save you a lot of money but nobody comes here for a bargain right Yes I know the are not that steep here I m from where there is nothing but Let s see the other times I have eaten here I can remember that the service is nominal they are usually busy and have a lot of tables The and were usually greasy and the chips for were a little stale On a parallel note this place will probably never die because there is always an influx of out of like me that are willing to pay a premium for bad food and service If you are a first timer here you must at least try here one time for the experience It s really not that bad until you been here about timesOutstanding view and good However the food and so does the service For those who live on Lake Travis like myself it s kind of a once in a while place to go but if you are from out of town you really can t find a view like this anywhere inis good But their food The view is great Like their band actually dancing on the deck there But waiting list is too long We for one hour to get a tableBeautiful view but horrendous bar food Service was great and good but food was barely edibleI haven t been back to the oasis since P and I responsible for burning it to the ground Here s the story Our large circle of had just spent most of the day out at the lake swimming and fooling around and drinking I believe it was the same day that swam the entire width of the lake and back in under and then threw up on Shiny Kyle Anyway we decided after swimming to head over to the Oasis and have some grub before heading home There were about of us and our buddy s even up as they were visiting to do some house hunting and to meet all of their son s mostly me It to cloud up and look stormy during dinner which added fantastic cloud coloring to the one thing that The Oasis consistently does right they have the best sunset in the State The food that day as most other times I have been there was average to good and the service as most other times I have been there was slow All through dinner we could hear the rumbling of thunder in the background and kept telling me how she was afraid of being struck by lightning I of course had to tell her my about my friend who been struck by lightning and twice about how it probably t hurt much about how the odds of lightning the deck were pretty high but her in particular were only slim as there were lots of taller people hanging out with us Needless to say this t allay her much but I was a lot of fun teasing her And then sometime later that night after we left the place got struck by lightning and nearly burned to the ground I do not make lightningon I m from and was on vacation Well actually looking to relocate to This place and the Lake Travis area in general was certainly a highlight of my trip AMAZING of the Hill Country I the Strawberry Too bad my in line half of the time we were there no exaggeration Service was TERRIBLE But I love the South People are so kind A wonderful busy gentleman with a lot of and other at his table thought of us and provided us with for our table since the staff was ignorant to that Our waitress stopped by once and never again I all of my education through so I understand the industry and what it s like to be busy But they are significantly Amazing live music They kept the crowd of all going long into the night Impressive building structure well thought out patio design Will come again but will certainly eat at another restaurant beforehand I look forward to some property ridiculously cheap property on Lake Travis and some healthy business competitionThe view from this restaurant is absolutely especially at sunset The food is mediocre nothing special at all We stuck with chicken and after reading Service was also friendly enough staff but nothing that gave me a warm inviting feeling it is a restaurant though Also much more of a touristy spot the view is the main thing that people inThey are on the side but it t worth it The food is not as great as you would hope so I ordered that were hot and fresh but the never too interested in our needs although they did refill our when we and took care of us they just t have much personality I did go during the sunset and it truly amazing We chose to sit outside on the balcony there are multiple and you can choose The gift shoo is expensive The only part i was the view For people our bill was and we didnt get Not worth itThe view is magnificent Great place to watch the sunset This is a great place to take a date probably for a second date I highly recommend The in downtown as a place for a first date however sit on the patio and you have a great view of the building if you lion straight up at night Anyways great The are The food in general is not that great this is really just for the viewBeautiful setting and great Plenty of tables available and multiple of restaurant Have vegetarian and available No one came around to fill Had to ask to refill our many times and it was always a struggle to find someone to fill them We would ask people cleaning up tables to find our waitress but that t seem to help considering we ended up to go find her ourselves for the check I my meal without cheese and they brought it out with cheese and t provide an apology for this Food came out by the time everyone else finished Food was very average nothing special It s really solely about the view not the foodThis is a tricky thing to review because this place is either a hit or miss hence the You either have an amazing experience or you don t I been here a handful of times and I love taking first time here When it s a great experience you get a GREAT view of the sunset while you have dinner and the staff is super nice Here s when it becomes a bad experience I took my here recently first time mind you so I to make sure she would enjoy it and after waiting in line for about which t bad really I in line for an hour before the hostess told us it would be a hour and a half wait We got there early so I that would be fine with us After waiting almost later I for an update They told me it was going to be another I to them I was tired of waiting and t appreciate how they kept extending the wait time I mean really who goes to a restaurant and stays at their table for Here s where I really got upset I saw people getting seated that AFTER US Which they literally forgot about us I went back to the hostess and the situation Just out of the blue they said to a water hey can you go bring them to table or whatever the number was And also the table was in a TERRIBLE spot It was literally out in the corner and we had to squeeze through other tables to get there Also the waiter like he working there The food and were fine but he very unhappy for some reason What an embarrassing first impression When we to leave I for a manager and for several At this point I was exhausted so I t even care Bottom line go here when they re SUPER slow which is rare cause you most likely get a better experienceThe view is and always been great The food not so much It gotten better over the but one really comes here for the view the and the very good The service is usually excellent Watch your bill if you come for lunch make sure they don t charge you dinner It s a cool place to bring out of town but warn them the view is really what it s about not the over priced mediocre foodThe view the view the view What else can I add that people have not already Service was super nice they have some great local brewery and they have this VIEW of the lake that is unmatched I will say that I was not with my chili chicken The dish more of that awesome chili flavor Mine was rather flat boring So I was disappointed in that piece But hey did I mention the VIEWThis review is based on everything besides food I had so many bad on the food so I t going to even try to prove everyone wrong I that the were spectacular and that s why I went First of all the drive from downtown to The Oasis was so windy and beautiful I felt like I t in which was a nice change There was plenty of parking and even a golf cart to hitch a ride with The place was so much bigger than I had My and I immediately went upstairs to grab wine and a seat to await the view obligatory sunset pic The line to order our was a little long but pretty normal for I greatly the customer service and at The Oasis I will definitely be for some live musicThis place is for food and service domestic beer is reasonably priced although like most these days they charge an arm and a leg for a margarita that the them the same but for the most part is less It s all about the view here and if you want to get a good seat by the rail for the view before the come down you need to wait with a giant bowl of soup that was really chili soup and a dinner in itself My of chicken and steak came without the steak and they it as a side dish Both were extremely tender but flavor Quantity was ample so no although they could provide more e g sour cream and Endless chips andThe ride out to the Oasis is really pretty it is quite hilly with a lot of curvy It is a good spot to take out of town A plus to this place is there is a ton of parking unlike a lot of in We have from multiple that the food is horrible and to eat elsewhere before you go so we always do this We try to hit happy hour as we have the refillable beer glasses The best part about this bar restaurant is the view It can t be beat You can see the majority of lake Travis and all the and jet are fun to watchOf course this place a great view and is the reason most people go The that they have was definitely one of the best vegetarian I have had The reason for the star review was that the were completely inconsiderate and rudeGreat with service and food The ambience of the restaurant me of Azteca or a similar restaurant I to sit outside and the waitress made it seem like that was a big deal Most of the tables outside were empty and she put me at a table with of the lake I to move and they also made a big deal out of that I can understand if it were busy but the outdoor area was only Come here if you want food and service but a romantic settingI have lived in for over and the Oasis for the view and that is about it The food is par on to a chain quality place During the the menu is naturally limited and the still remain quite high for what is Honestly the last time I ate here was for a party I had chips and and a grilled chicken salad The chicken was extremely and dry the in the salad were not fresh and the dressing desired freshness as you can tell it was made and for I did not fare to send it back because I felt for the waitress who was her backside to hustle and make right for many people I tipped well for the wait staff and not the quality of the food I have sequentially come her in and of all for special and I do not see myself aspiring to go here because I get the urge to say go to the Oasis I am just an honest reviewer and over the it declined in quality and the haveSomehow my adventure also included a miniature tour of the great state of and hook em Actually I was super excited to get to go to because my best friend went to UT and I so many about this town over the I got a brief tour of downtown and a drive by of campus and we were off to Lake Travis Wow Talk about beautiful surroundings At this point in my tour of I wound up at the Oasis The view is absolutely stunning The Oasis is a three of the lake The sunset is amazing The phrase God s country comes to mind Everyone should go here and take lots of As for the food and service not so much The fish were mediocre The margarita kind of so I switched to Shiner When in or rather Service was forgettable I d definitely go back Just next time I d stick to happy hour onlyI went to the oasis yesterday for the first time The view is very nice so that s why people over the restaurant The food is decent andLake Travis is beautiful on any sunny day how can you not want to bring family here to enjoy the view Especially when you re no where near the beach this is the next best thing to watch the sunset On the other hand Oasis needs a lot of work on the staff food and the tacky I can see this place getting fixed up and better food on the menu Have you ever watched the movie Waiting I get that Someone call Chef I know they are busy already but it could be even more and people want to come back I came out here twice with besides enjoying the view the only thing I was the chips and fruity mixed Valet parking for is a bonusFood is great is great Disappointing the not being in tune with the audience The people on the dance floor were not interested in the music he kept and he completely the for different Too bad It was a beautiful night beautiful weather and a great place to out but the music needs to be more in sync with what the audienceSuper duper awesome service spectacular view but maybe you t really eat here My relative ordered a side of sweet potato and it was a very sad and tiny basket Everything else just it s definitely a place where you are paying more for the view or atmosphere than food We did get complimentary chips and with our though I also they don t have too many on tap here but again it t seem like that sort of placeAfter living in for over I finally made my way out to the Oasis this past week when I was at the resort about away When we I was really I had always though it was just some big restaurant with a nice view but there was actually a lot more to the immediately surrounding area such as and dessert unfortunately closed down now but still cool to see After waiting in line for we got our name on the which was an additional Being that everywhere right around was closed that left us to sitting around in the heat which was rather unenjoyable but still a nice view Once our time came we were taken to our table I must say that all the and were super cool and really in the sense that it was weird in a cool way We ended up waiting another before the food and by the time we got outside it was too dark to really see the view that much The entire time we were there we had to wait long whiles before getting anything we The food was pretty good but honestly not worth the wait I my experience and had a good time but the amount of waiting was crazy We a long time for our food for our for chip Being that it s a popular place I understand but more staff would easily solve this problem and lead to high guest satisfaction this t have been a major issue for a Overall had a good time but way more waiting that it was worth and they also t do anything for which was a disappointmentView is the worthy thing in this place Food not too good I would expect something better for that place Waitress are attentiveLong wait and they don t take The view was amazing and the food and service were If you are coming here for a experience then save yourself the trip If you want a great view with a chilled drink and some good then it s what you re looking forThis was quite a disappointment for me I gone here so many times but tonight something must have been in the water because every waitress that brought us our or food was definitely RUDE if it s corona or them to wear the the service received today was horrible was my waitress for a table of and she t five two about what was wrong with our our being low bottomless chips being just nothing It was just bad When she gave the biggest attitude wasted food on me t say excuse me It took A LOT NOT to go off and ask for a manager to correct the issue My came from different and I about The Oasis and how amazing it was However they were left with a horrible taste in their mouth Please do better and and have your learn the menu and fix their the food was good Thank you food staff you re the reason I gave AThe view is tremendous but the food was lackluster The food at the bar was far better and thoughtful But the actual menu and food at the reservation spot was quite Gorgeous during the sunset thoughGo for the view stay for a cocktail and enjoy the view but go elsewhere for food The margarita s are good I had a this trip and it was well done The chips were nothing special but paired well with theSuper t matter what time you come here We came around but the wait time is already If you can get the table outside with the view super nice especially at sunset However there s no social here Tables were close to each other and the restaurant is super crowded Food was mediocre Nothing special Would not eating at this restaurant again but might come back for the view walking around explore the area',\n",
       " 4.0: 'The food More flavor is always a good thing We took of our there for lunch and were seated in We took the to take and appreciate the view ahead Service is considering it was really busy We got seated in the nest which is my place to sit whenever I go here are great lake filled up and the little have Parking was a little interesting as we had to walk across the street but it was not a big issue it was a nice day out The expansion is well underway cant wait to see itSo first of all this would be only after dark Really the menu should never get more than But the are so over the top incredible that it got to give it a boost I have eaten here a number of times and in the past I was very unimpressed with service and food I like to go there for a lazy lunch and enjoy the view This time the food was much and the service was good So eating good food and getting great service while sitting up in on of the higher the nest ask to be seated there was a really great experience It really made my day and the experience fourGreat Service was friendly but slow I ordered the shrimp lettuce It was good but I shrimp to be biggerSunset was beautiful staff amazing thank you our waitress and the for showing our Boston family a great time The egg men put on a great showThis is a beautiful place so many people Never had to wait for our seat or food Service by was phenomenal He was very attentive and friendly and added to the great atmosphere of the place We went for the sunset and were not disappointed What a great place to see it The food was delicious too The was fresh and had a little bit of a kick I got chicken and shrimp that were yummy The rice and were a bit blah but those were just anyway The are delicious and go down way too fast A definite must stop destination if you re visiting But also great for a casual night out with and familyI had the shrimp They come with rice black you have a choice corn or flour and avocado with lettuce and tomato I t too crazy about the rice and the were good The shrimp were delicious My husband had the spicy chicken and it came with He said the sandwich The were really good Service was prompt and friendly The view is very beautiful Worth visiting by the view alone This is a level restaurant and a gift store in it as well EnjoyGreat place Gorgeous scenery and good service Can get crazy on Right after we ate the line for dinner wrapped around the outside lobby twice Some We were glad not to e in that line Went back to after a year or this time with our first baby Good time good food good service amazing view Just wish it were sunny We had the with and fish plate was very good were also good but is not much flavor We make it much better at home Rice and were pretty goodThe amazing view and upscale yet casual atmosphere still remains but the quality of the food at the Oasis tremendously since I was there in I had a grilled chicken salad with that was amazing Everyone in my party of their The chips are also very tasty and fresh With the exception of slow service fantastic place all the way Don t miss this treatThe food is actually pretty decent but then it s not really that either You come here for an awesome view and to enjoy some with It s out of the way but you are a fool to pass it up for that reason Take SH if you want a fun ride to get there Plenty of parking and a great atmosphere this place upThis is a very special spot to dine with a view really could have stayed there all day taking We were also seated in a very unique spot with a spectacular view The service unfortunately was a catch with where we were seated amazing view but out of eye line sight for our waitress we did a lot of waiting though to be fair it was very busy also The food was very good can recommend the chicken and beef as well as the There are many and little to wander around and check out also Did I mention the view Definitely worth a visitI can see the food what the folk come to this place for but I m not going to bother that since I t order anything out of the ordinary either I had a steak at a place it was good though I m going to review about the view a GREAT PHOTO spot which I did take some awesome of my and family while there Watched the sunset and the down below This place is huge When my friend told me it had and we re eating on the top I at her funny and it off But when we it like a fort over the water With little and a few more sorry I can t remember and Uncle Billy s The FUN part was the dancing section that they took me and my little guy to after dinner I m not a good dancer but man this place was and some good from the live band The man on the guitar out had the crowd going as well as the youngster lead singer making all the older ladies swoon It was a fun night The only problem is the room t have that much air moving so with all that body heat around from everyone dancing man it made me a hot sweaty mess and not in the cute sexy way that they portray on those stupid axe up for the Oasis a cool little spot I d return to from SanAmazing view Food and service are not great I wish there would be an improvement on the food because it s a great place to take to see gorgeous lake side Just eat before you goGorgeous place The lake view is stunning Definitely worth the stop if you are visitingHere s my breakdown from two between multiple weekend for and also went for Easter brunch Easter brunch was amazing Here we go Regular weekend Positive There is no better view for and food Some are good like and some Negative Service mediocre at best Some food needs some overhaul Easter Brunch Only Positive Great food amazing selection around can t remember per head expensive but well worth it Was done nice and would recommend for anyone wanting to eat out for Easter brunch Conclusion like many note food is around along with the service but the view is star Everyone in should at least go here once Easter brunch was best my family had everyone from shrimp to prime rib Hope this allI been visiting The Oasis since I was a They have never really been known for their food It s always been about that beautiful view of the sunset and the lake I remember going here after I graduated from high school By the way lightning struck and burned down a chunk of the the very next day June I believe Since that time back in I really feel like The Oasis turned the corner from mediocre weekend spot to dependable gathering point for you and your The development of everything surrounding the restaurant financially The restaurant always stayed strong though The developer had large to build a domain style shopping paradise Uncle used to be right next door I t have the there great enough for the drive though Now it like everything is going well for the restaurant The parking garage is in The walkway was built a few ago They seem to have also the Uncle Billy s brewery area for their own Oasis brewery We had a group of people for a little friendly gathering The Oasis t do but you can call ahead and they really do their best to accommodate your party We at on a busy evening The line had about people in it already Like a machine the staff worked through each group There is a large bar on the level where everyone up drinking while they wait for a table There is also live music on this level Our group ahead the day before and were given a wait time of about an hour to an hour and a half We were initially disappointed but then our buzzer buzzing about later They had indeed saved us an area for our large group Definitely call ahead if you are a large gathering Your entire group must be present before they can be seated The food here is still but it s really about the sunset Pick a day with nice weatherthe view Watching the sunset while drinking cider is probably at least one of my top favorite I m only not giving due to the limited food menu for people with foodAn classic The food is but the people just come for the view It s gorgeous at sunset just too bad that the lake is extremely low So sad I love the sipper for a refreshing drink and the chicken pecan saladIf you are looking for great food fast service and drink The Oasis is not for you However if you are looking to spend a few with a fantastic view of Lake Travis and settle for low grade with dollar in the world then you should go there I have been there several times because it such a great view and the atmosphere me of being on vacation BUT the service is really bad and the food is just about average know they are paying for the view not the food and it s a great place to take out of they are too to care about the food in my experience Here s a tip though the will try to seat you in a spot even when there are fantastic open You need to be and you will get a spot on an upper deckCame after so I can only judge by the atmosphere but we sat on the deck and had a drink while listing to a good band play Can t wait to see this place during the day sunsetThe view was incredible but if you have mobility or with walking use the before you get seated Also in the area is not clear We spent just looking for the correct entrance Even though the and food were a bit everything was delicious The chicken are huge We split the basket which included between two and there was more than enoughVenue and Service Food We came in for lunch yesterday This is a really nice place with an incredible view It at the edge of a cliff on Lake Travis It of outside in addition to the indoor seating area and bar The outside ample shade via and plenty of that provide a nice breeze so you are comfortable even when it s hot out This place is also know for its sunset as you can imagine It is a huge venue that also large and up to The service here is very good like they were short or yesterday but ours was so good that we did not have a problem You get a complimentary chips and when you site down It was pretty good especially the We ordered a couple of with My wife had the cheeseburger and I had the Both were decent but not great They were not overly juicy or greasy at all With a bit of pink in the center it a leaner grade of meat To me this is goodness Mine had cheese on it but the kitchen forgot the grilled It took halfway through my meal to get them and I was still for for them Oh well They do not rush you here so you have plenty of time to have a leisurely meal and take in the I will definitely come back the next time I am in townView is absolutely amazing Food was good I ordered the Grilled Shrimp and a strawberry margarita and really both I would definitely recommend this restaurant especially for the beautiful view of Lake Travis This will definitely be added to me list of inFood was very good and the view was to die for We came for the sunset and we were delighted What a great spot to relax at the end of the day Wait was a tad long but we came at peak time Food took a good bit to come out offer but to be fair they were very busyThe food and the wait were nothing more than decent but I think that the view if you choose to eat outside is The Oasis is a good place to get a little something to eat watch the go by on the lake and enjoy the weatherI love Oasis I love the art the design of the place I love the view especially I actually t have to wait long for any seat and it was on a weekend I guess it just on where you want to sit and everything I m not sure I love it though The food t the best ever but the were and that s good enough for me I haven t had a waiter waitress mean to me yet but I will let you know if it This is one of my favorite to eat in when I visit frequentlyI m going to give this place for because our experience here is excellent that we ate dinner before we came so we did not sample menu other than to try a margarita We had been told in advance that the food was not that great but the view was spectacular We ordered chips and and a house margarita We stayed for the sunset and it was well worth the wait The place is crowded but our experience with the wait staff was excellent Everyone was kind and we were seated promptly When a table with a better view available we if we could move and they us up on our request with no hesitation at all We felt like we got the best in the house We will definitely recommend this place to anyone of our who It is a must seeI will not talk down on the Oasis the food is and the service is fine but what is great about this place is the view go during the week when it s less crowded and the sunset is amazing your breath awayFood was good band was great service was terrible We came on a evening Not very busy when we but picked up and turned in to a fun atmosphere We stayed and the dancing The band The Brew was awesome All in our group with the exception of one their We had a wide array of food and it was all pretty good Wish we could say the same for our waitress but she was honestly terrible She from moment one rarely checked on us in fact I used chips as a fork to eat almost my entire meal as I t have any and she never came to check on us She just t seem engaged in the That was until the check came which we had to ask for and wait forever for Then she our acting like she an even bigger tip than the one auto on It s a good thing they added one otherwise she t have gotten much as she t work to deserve it Normally I don t pick apart as they could have had a rough day but I am telling you she was one of the worst I have ever had Rarely came by and when she did she t very friendly And it t just when they were busy It was from the beginning We will be back but I can guarantee that we will ask for another server Hopefully she is the only bad one in the bunch as she put a damper on our evening Still giving a star though as the rest of the experience was great to move it up to after our next visitgo there for the amazing of the and lake travis the wait could be long so a good idea would be to just buy a drink and walk aroundThe view is absolutely beautiful We t have to wait to be seated The fish and are pretty good Service was mediocre It took almost to get the bill and we had to ask several times for more to drink When we left we saw the waitress Sue sitting at the bar and on her phone The view is awesomeMuch like everyone else said I go to the Oasis mainly for the and scenery of Lake Travis The service and from time to time and the food is a little over priced However the greatly outweigh those and it become one of my favorite I ever beenSome of ours came into town for the weekend we decided to head up to Lake Travis and go to The Oasis There was a decent wait to be at on a but we had a blast We a drink at the bar and got to watch the sunset It was definitely They definitely have the perfect view We t actually end up eating once we got to our table besides their trio Make sure you check out their brewery after dinner for or just to sit by the fire and relax It was perfectI had my th birthday dinner at the Oasis It was wonderful The food was really good It used to be about the equivalent of concert concession stand It t The salad was fresh and the were really good everyone was The view was awesome as alwaysGreat atmosphere and great Excellent place for special are great Food is goodFirst of all the view is outstanding We sat outside on the deck and it was gorgeous We tried the brisket as an appetizer and they were the best food we tried there The were well made as well I had the spicy chicken sandwich and my husband had both were simply They t awful but they t good either are about what you would expect higher than a normal lunch place but less than a high quality restaurant We would definitely return if only for and the viewThe Oasis is a wonderful place on the and They have a live band that you dancing The are good The food is style but it s not what they re known for The Oasis is known for their location on Lake Travis Now that the lake is full thank you rain the Oasis is the place to be to look out at the water have a cocktail and dance the night awayAs I was reading the I felt a bit to try it But gave it a try as it to have a great view The view is amazing No doubt The are Decided to give the person a try and were very tender with great taste satisfied with the meal enough for Server was Very polite Will come back againMe and a bunch of came here for a friend s birthday and we had a good time Great service excellent but the food was just Our server was so patient and sweet If you re thinking about coming DO IT You won t be disappointedBest frozen in The food is hot or however we had the steak tonight and they were totally on point Tortilla chips warm and taste homemade beautiful view of the lake Some of the other food not as good but give this place a try especially if you have out of town or a date nightFood is average or even bellow average but the service was good and view is amazing especially during sunset Will come again for and Definitely a must visit spot in I haven t checked out the brewery yetVery nice view service was great and food was pretty tasty We came at am on Mother s Day and the place filled up right away The staff was ready and they did a great jobI had a good here with my husband listening to the live band and view were awesome Should have stuck with only chips and The food is not their strong point at all I had red fish which was a little and no flavor at all I will go back but not for the food Our waiter was very good thoughHere s the deal you can get better food elsewhere you can get better service elsewhere however the volume of people that go through here it impossible to create a star food experience at a price everyone can afford It s like going to World you re not going to get the best food or the best service but you will have a good timeI have to be honest with this one the only reason I m giving it so many is because of the atmosphere and the view I don t think I have ever had really good service here always more Their perfect margarita is pretty generic and food is pretty over priced for with and stale chips With all that said I Love this place It s one of my favorite go to s when people visit from out of state If you go for an early dinner and catch the sunset over the lake you will be so with the trek you took from proper Just remember you re not getting a royal star treatment you are there to breath fresh air enjoy a gorgeous restaurant with stunning and love the company you re with You can t go wrong as long as that s your mind set As for wisely so you can get the most of your experience I recommend the and a micro brew You will be a happy camper You can also treat this place like a quick drink and chips spot before a more supple meal else where Enjoy and don t forget your cameraWaiting time was not Long we got seated right away The food was pretty normal for your basic restaurant nothing Special I ordered the spicy with whatsoever For drink I ordered the banana was delicious and very smooth The tropical depression was good too sweet and you could not taste the alcohol at all The view was nice I would say you pay for the view rather than the food Nice place to come once or twice It was a tad over priced with a view like that o t mindare just for the view which is beautiful The were good too I got the pina The food was not that tasty and the wait was sunset hour on a during Memorial Day weekend so it was busy My recommendation is don t go during the summer maybe fall and not on a busy weekend Have a drink and enjoy the free chips and with a view to be seated outsideAwesome view and location We have to come here every year fish are greatGrowing up I would visit my in every summer This restaurant was always my favorite and in my opinion is still a can t miss if you re exploring The food never my off but lake at Sunset make up for it and then some Unless you re ridiculously stubborn about the best fare for your buck you love the Oasis and take a lot ofThe View and yes it s well worth it I highly recommend before sunset and prepare to wait The are great as well The service was poor when I ate there for dinner You might think it was a busy night but the waiter even told me it was nothing to what he s seen before Apparently it was just an average night The food was good but nothing special When it comes down to it you come here for the view not the food It definitely that the taste great I would happily come here again and in fact plan to for the father s day brunch But you take the good with the bad great view and for only food poor service All in all I left this restaurant happy that I cameWell I had nothing but a good time there Sometime work out wrong food wise but they are willing to make it right are good service is usually GOOD but can be iffy if really busy GREAT sunset free great and BIG dance floor I say it s worth itGreat service from out waiter now bad driving from one of their speeding the parking lot she was driving a goldAmbience scenery customer service and good food what else do we need You can sit on outdoor the lake travis your and on complimentary View is amazing for sunset but worth the view Might have to wait a while on as it will be crowded Private and can be organized with huge parking lotsGreat of the lake some of the best in food is good but not as good as the view Decent menu choice but nothing spectacular It s really a star on food for and star for view Lots of outdoor seating but service does get slow when it s even medium traffic Decent and a good choice ofI recently went for the sweetheart dinner and left very Our waiter was attentive and nice enough to answer our with a smile Our food filet mignon were tasty the dessert was perfect portion sizes were large enough to share with my date By far my best experience here so far My only suggestion would be to have some background music when the violinist took his breakCan t beat the sunset view They also had a live band the day my and I were there they were awesome Perfect summer sunset Food is decent I m not many I went for the It was Overall food is mediocre but you come here for the view and maybe a drinkfor view or for the food Admittedly I was a poor college student when I ate here several times so I t afford the menu But in general the food I had was quite mediocre The view however is spectacular is the city I been too and I live in No Cal right now and the cocky here all are certain they live in the place in the country and the view from this place is near the top of the best view I haven t been here in a couple of as of now and the deck burned down about a year ago I hear they it with an even greater deck So I suspect arson Nonetheless I can t comment on the current deck setupThe most breath taking view of Lake Travis you will ever find The food was pretty good too but the service left a little to desire a really long time for our food think the waitress forgot to turn in ticket and took a while for her to check on us I had the rubbed and wife had Both of us it Little but the food and view were worth it Hopefully their wait service is better next timeWe came here for the view If you t from then it s definitely worth coming here for a drink and a or an appetizer Beautiful setting and of course as was the norm the staff was sweet as pieThis review I think is purely for the view and the shrimp I have to say this t really the best place for anything because everything is than it to be and the service is only However they really do make a killer margarita and a shrimp We came here after a day on Lake Travis just to sight see and take in the The menu was sparse and were but we decided to eat here anyway It t a horrible choice since they had this shrimp which basically is like large tiger and somehow together in a patty It was HUGE I swear there were like in there maybe not but like a good It was well worth it Along with the delicious margarita it made for a nice sunny too warm day to view the lake and how gorgeous the scene is from The Oasis but obviously only for a view or the shrimpFood is not the best around You but the view for the most part But it s fun are good Over priceI read all the before coming and did not have high for the food however was a killer view I was blown away by the sunset It was a lovely evening to be outside We were pleasantly by the food We ordered and to start Both were very good We had the which were very tasty and strong I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich because it was a safe move It ended up being quite good I would go here again primarily for the view and theAfter finding this place on the top to do in we were excited to try it out however after reading the Yelp we were worried that the view was amazing but the food would be horrible We must have come with low because we were pleasantly My husband had a and I had the Chicken Appetizer chicken and bacon All were above average We sat outside on the patio however our walkway table had an view My recommendation is to tell them at the host station you want an outside table along rail with an unobstructed view also said the service was bad Our server was and she did a great jobThe Oasis is an institution They call it the sunset capital of and it is The from the are nothing less than spectacular In times past when I I t to keen on the food or the service But I really must say the food and service have greatly I was also really happy to see the lake full againWe went for the sunset and desert Both were great The wait for a table was honestly way to long The restaurant had two or three more they could have seated and people at but instead they have you what for to an hour We a drink at the bar and our to a table in the where they were not serving anyone until we received a that our table was ready about from the time they took down my name Disappointing to say the least I leave this review on a good note just because the are great Go check it outThis place is a star restaurant only because there is of need for some type of shade in the restaurant The food is a because it taste for example my were lukewarm and were not the i m used to It s all about the scenery Get there at wait for sunset have a couple of cold but eat somewhere else The brewery next door a big discount on its if you keep the glass you buyWe added Oasis into our must see list during the trip to This place is amazing mostly because of the fantastic view and the unique Service is attentive Food is average Our were not clean And place is still popular I really have a mixed impression about this place The management needs to work on quality of food and the cleanliness of they serve inWell I have been to the Oasis several times and I have consistently said and as most people I know will say The food is the service but the view is Awesome Well this time which is why I am writing this review The food was good the view was amazing but this time I can say our service was AWESOME This goes beyond it to previous experience was just adorable and professionally AWESOME If I could have her every time I would go more often She was attentive to our table She to our about the food She a suggestion sweet potato and they were as yummy a star the food the sweet potato made the meal and the view with sunset atmosphere that fact that I was inspired to write this review I had a very good time and the difference was Thank you and both s I know are just as sweet My wife and I really did enjoy your service I hope the tip we left assured you that you made a difference for our evening Thank you from the Young Old Couple from evening When we come back we will be sure to ask for you Keep up the good workAn amazing view not to be while enjoying a cold beer Absolutely fantastic on a nice day That being said stick with chips and The food is about as below average as itthe Oasis is really based on the and beautiful scenery The menu always been so so although the are tasty The are excellent You can t beat the sunset here it s a great place to take out of for a beautiful experienceI agree with other This is best known for the scenery more than the food Still itThe view is worth stopping by My husband and I came out on a visit to We ordered the flat bread barbecue brisket It was a good appetizer for the price But don t order if cheese is not your thing The service was fairly descentOne of my favorite to go to when I m in From the drive up there to the view while we were there is absolutely GORGEOUS They do not take but even with a party of we were seated right by the water within There is parking not too far from the restaurant but valet parking is also available All of our food was good but the sweet potato were a little burnt and not to our liking Forgot to take of the food sorry Definitely will be coming back though and we all had a great time are top notch Food Service ViewThe food at the Oasis is bland and but in consideration of these you get a spectacular view of Lake Travis If you are visiting for the first time you should definitely come to the Oasis no reservation but you might have to wait a bit for a table with a view I usually get the here They are expensive but the single serving is always enough for me and my to share The perfect margarita is like every other margarita in but perfect on a hot day There is usually a band and some they have dancing The Oasis is a great place to bring a date orI off on going to this place since the were so so So when I did go I t much But the view me away Amazing I now take all my out of town there The food is decent I always gone during off times never during a sunset so maybe that is why I m happy with the place If you re an amazing food experience go somewhere else If the weather is pretty and you want a nice view go herewas an attentive waiter who was by other staff to make my birthday dinner extra special We had a table right on the lake with a perfect sunset view We about and had no problem getting the perfect table The chicken were a great appetizer The shrimp were tender and the were flavorful They me to a brownie for dessert We read quite a few bad and do not agree with thenThis is one of the best smoked salmon I have tasted It is truly unbelievable I would suggest this restaurant to go in day time for better viewWent there with some the last night we were in for Here s my review Food I thought it was excellent The chips was good especially if you add the dip I had the as my entree it was very good My wife had the steak she finished her plate so that she them a lot Service The service was very good Atmosphere The restaurant is on Lake Travis The of the lake and the sunset are amazing Also the sheer size of the place is mind blowing The can seat up to people in one sitting There are multiple and plenty of outdoor seating Other The drive from t too bad We were in North at the It took us less than to get there The are tasty They had Stag s Leap Cabernet on the menu that me Will I return Absolutely There are a bunch of other on the menu that I want to sampleThe view is it s a must have Mother s Day brunch was terrific great service wonderful food selection The sunset and the view is worse the high cost on non holiday menuMet some here on a gorgeous day the st weekend in They had never been and thought it would be a great place to catch up on the patio I t been in prior to the fire So when they and told us to park on the level of the garage I was sure they were in the wrong spot We up and it was a jaw dropping change I was speechless and said probably every couple This place used to be kind of laid back a bit rickety tiered patio Now there are still that are of the old days but the are worth it Now it s not just the Oasis it s like it s own little town Service was fine was awesome and I had some chicken which were good but I was more concerned with the than on anything else I will definitely return and recommend for first Great experienceY know eh Went here on a night at We were on the call ahead list which that we were seated when our full party was there but there is no list available Although the parking lot like one to a theme park seriously GIGANTIC and there were of people at the restaurant we did not have to wait which I t expect for that time of day May I just say WOW Huge Gigantic Four The hostess counter like mission control Each room a different theme and We were seated in a really ugly room with carpet that me of a cross between a hotel and a casino The view was gorgeous even though we were inside It was too hot to go outside And honestly I was happy with my food I got the Big O and the beef was perfect my were crisp and delicious and although the bun was a little too squishy it was still yummy I had to ask for ketchup which I thought was weird because most have ketchup sitting out on tables all of the time but then I that there were probably tables in that restaurant and it would been a pain for the to deal with them The rest of my group was also happy with their respective meal different enchilada They that the Oasis probably had to get people to come back after the fire so they the food quality a little And our waiter was good Not excellent but goodWhoa what a view over the hill country and Lake Travis a pitifully low on water right now Lake Travis blanketing the sky in a rainbow of color that s the Oasis Before was a city before was lane and before it was discovered spent time out this way Today the are just as spectacular the food just a and it is still a fun place to go and tip a drink or two It never been gourmet instead a stop on the way to or from a fun time at the lake Check out their web site for special event private for and many more little they added over the for food for the view service on the day the crowd who s working that day The fire was well and June They were hit by lighteningGo just for and to enjoy the sunset t have any food were a bit steep but we knew that already reading previous were decent but view was absolutely spectacular about get there early because it busy quickWho about the food when all you need is a drink the view and a smile at the Oasis The spectacular view of the lake anything else you could possibly be thinking about when you dine here They have indoor seating but who the heck to sit inside unless of course its cold or rainy They do have a few good on the menu but its far from great think of it as lake food minus the Its really a fun place especially for people who are from out of town and looking to see the beauty of the Hill Country I take from work there often for lunch and we always have a great time So stop worrying about the food get yourself a beer or margarita listen to some live music and enjoy the glow of the setting sunGreat view great food The Southwestern Lettuce were AMAZING My husband and I the and a chicken salad The were our favorite down Probably some of the best we ever had the food we ordered came out in less than Great view at a window table as Fun gift shop to visit if you re trying to pass time or to check out after eating Took a while to actually place our order for two though the time the food came out in made up for it t seem crazy busy but we did sit waiting for someone to help us for a while Had to ask for majority of silverware since only were provided at table would recommend butter included and for big to be brought out with a large spoon or fork especially lettuce which require scooping food Just some for the restaurant Overall a up experience and we will return next year when we re in town again for ThanksRead some of the bad here and was skeptical We came around on a night and t have to wait at all We were seated on the lower deck behind another row of people which t ruin the view but made it not as spectacular We had to wait about before we were able to order and another before we could order food The food came out relatively quickly and was pretty good Overall the food view and environment was well worth the money Will definitely return I really also how they the live music upstairs from the rest of the restaurant It kept the view more scenic for some and the music great forThe of lake Travis are priceless A must visit place in The service is very good The chips and are excellent I personally like ranch with the chips The are not good and are over priced are very well prepared but again Sol is my favorite drink here Love the sweet potato they serve with theWe love going there for their dancing nights always funBest view a can have The food was but we really came here for the view Recommend coming in the mornings so it s not too hot We ordered an alcoholic drink and the salmon plate You get to keep the as Our server was awesome and had a positive attitude The salmon was excellent it came with sweet potato and spinach The were my Definitely must give it a try It had a hint of spicy to it but it was overall pretty good are a bit extreme thoughWe read the before we went today and were a little worried I had been here ago and was pleasantly when we up They made this stand alone restaurant into an outdoor experience We came on a weekday for lunch and it t crowded at all We had Mel or we t hear him as our server and he was awesome He gave great service and we were The was delicious and we split the The chicken was bland but that s the only complaint hence the Overall it was a great experience and I m glad I took my husband thereWhen I think of I picture excessive of and Not And that is exactly why I LOVE this place it is so unique form because of the location not the food so don t come anything like s or Cabana Just order a margarita some and relax as you watch the sunset over Lake TravisBeen here a couple times and I love the atmosphere The sunset is amazing and a great place for or a weekend dinner Definitely a must if it s your first time in Menu is and the food is but nothing out of the ordinary This is not a restaurant you go to try new food or if you re looking for sophistication If you re going to view the sunset make sure to check their first as they post the exact sunset time I would recommend an hour to hour a half prior to sunsetThe view get s and that s why people go The are nothing special and if you re doing say chips and you definitely eat them So why not a star review Well the food away from that Not much but enough that this place only Best view in Central and the Hill Country Sitting high on the above the south east side of Lake Travis just above and to the left of Hollow I had brunch dinner and here multiple times Did I mention that you go for the view Food is pretty mediocre and gotten better over the The last meal I ate there was actually quite good shrimp perhaps and the other two in my party also their meal When you see people walking out with doggy it s not that bad Unless they really are going to give it to their dog if I don t eat it neither should will my dog The staff is used to large and them fairly well I don t ever recall waiting for an unacceptable amount of time for any service there They now have a very nice gift shop and since they the parking lot and garage you no longer have to circle around x I think the are interesting and the out front is AWESOME I know it s so cliche to take your out of town there but seriously the view is worth it and then your won t wonder what the hell you re doing inThe view is spectacular You have a great view of Lake Travis especially at sunset The food is justI m probably going to repeat what have already said amazing just gorgeous of Lake Travis at sunset I never would have looking like this And food I found it to be uninspired It t terrible it just t memorable The were a little on the weak side in my opinion Come on a and expect about an hour and a half wait Here s what the star value for me the fact that there are a couple where you can chill while waiting for your table I love that they take your phone number and text when your table is ready you don t have to worry about them calling your name while you re out of earshot As the sun to go down come out of the woodwork to take down the giving everyone a great view of the lake and sunset It s pretty cool how efficient they are with this considering there are of this place is HUGE And finally they had a pretty sweet band the night I was there And they t country music yes I am a hater All in all it s a great place to go on a date or with a group of if you don t have anything else to do for the night The surrounding area is very pretty as well again I found myself thinking I can t believe this is If you re ever in I think it s worth the trip to check out just onceI read the and so I went with the idea that the food would be awful I took family that was visiting from out of town here They it They thought the view was amazing and indeed it was I ordered the spinach and was very The was some of the best around Service was great I wasYou know I m really only doing this because my seem to love the Oasis Every single time they come to visit they ask me to take them back here and the food and service was much better this time I get that they re a local business but what I don t love is how they seem to get a little too big for their as they say Nonetheless get the and do some dancing if they have a band and at least the night won t be too terribleWe were a little worried about the mixed but we had a good time We had a fantastic view seated outside at table Service was pretty decent for a crowded restaurant Wished they though There were at least other people waiting in line outside with us for about before they Also wished they had more vegetarian instead of just the Garden t have to be you know Just no meat maybe cheese and grilled without the meat laced sides I would gladly pay for that coupled with the viewI m going to start off and say that the food is bar food not spectacular not just plain bar food It won t blow you away it won t be awesome it will be sort of BUT I bet nobody really goes to Oasis for the food I only go to enjoy the sunshine and view The staff so far have all been nice to us and to be honest when I go there I plan on just sitting and admiring the view I m not going there when I have to be somewhere else later in the day or need to grab a quick bite I just go to go It s a neat place to bring out of but it s also great to J K I only get beer in the bottle however my wife s margarita was pretty darn strong so maybe we go when the right bartender is there It s unique it s away from the city and and it s fun Our last trip out our table a table conversation we went from of us to about people talking like we knew each other for awhile you make your I would sayThis place is fun Love the quirky Love the massive outdoor seating space Love the view The food was average but the t too outrageous so at least you t The really the chips and I also thought my chicken were pretty decent They gave you lots of chicken and Could have easily been a meal for two I m not really sure why this spot such bad Our service t perfect but it was such a lovely view we t mind enjoying it while waitingFirst time visiting the restaurant Very with the I had never seen any restaurant so huge The sunset was spectacular The food was good I had shrimp with coleslaw and The prefect margarita was prefect I would come again Just a reminder the wait can be long depending on the time of the day Depending on where you want to be seated they are for those who can t climb the ofAmazing place Easy and free parking Multiple to have a drink or dine in The live music on the terrace on is fantastic Just a few outside of downtown About the food can only recommend the can t go wrong with thatScenery is AMAZING the restaurant area is beautiful and fun however the food and service is not as amazing My margarita was watered down and it got in a plastic cup I still the experience of being there It definitely is a must see don t go for the food go for the view and spending time with yourgreat good food service quick Great Nice music upstairs I bring all out of town here for the and the shoppingI was here before but never really by the food simply came for the view But on my last visit I was actually really my lunch It was a pleasant surprise The menu a lot simpler than what I but it worked out for the best Will definitely come againThis can only be as a mixture of an outlet mall designed by Willy with gift office space and an amazing view of Lake Travis I must say I was a little confused at st but away liking it Great Food Great and even better a view like your in another world Forgot I was inThis is a historic landmark for Perhaps one of the most gorgeous and breath taking of I had the pleasure to visit this place while I was in of people that the fire to this place was a horrible point I disagree this forced them to create the with the new stage Now the band THE BREW every till after sun down This is perhaps the best night you can go to The Oasis You can sit down with your favorite company get some great and listen to some of the best from the band They play anything from to gypsy I find myself beating my to everything they play They also have free dance So dont be shy if you dont know how to dance but make sure you get a good partner because some of the best seen show up for this occasion not into the food the food is less than be desired but what do you expect from a place that over people at a single time I can only imagine how big the kitchen is Talk about mass production But with alcohol everything is better Make sure you come right before the sun set its breath taking to see the sun just melt into the Lake Travis and look at all the gorgeous and going across the water It almost unreal and you are in a dream Also one of the most romantic been to in So you can expect a good time lots of tourist of cool to look at in the flea market area and of gorgeous You will love the music and dont get to drunk because its still a long drive back to the cityThis is a place like no other Really the winner here is the atmosphere and uniqueness The service is great but the food are The were great but food was just so so We came a little bit early well in advance of sunset so that we could walk around the compound There are all of and to see here There is a very nice gift shop inside the Oasis I recommend getting here and posting up if you want to be outside for sunset We got a nice table the lake of course and out with hurricane I got the Tropical depression which was super and you get to take home the glass We received complimentary chips and for the table and then decided to order the chicken Anything we ordered came out fairly quickly The portion size of the was Flavor was Best thing was the and pico that came alongside Near time for sunset the staff comes around and down all the so everyone an unobstructed view We didnt stay for the complete sunset as we had somewhere else to be but what we saw even before was amazing The are I cannot believe this is Must see destinationIf you live in central this place is a drive to get to but it is very worth it It is a tiny little village within itself almost you usually have to park pretty far away because they have much parking and many people are always there at dinner time Then you walk through the market get your name on the list then go get a drink at one of the and try to find a seat at the bar with a view Definitely check out the sunset times for the night and make sure you will be there with enough time to get situated in time for the sunset The sunset here is beautiful and a beautiful view of the hill country and Lake Travis This is a huge restaurant and it is very successful for a reason and a few other have up on the hill next to it to try and get in on the rageWent on a weekday but I suppose because it was not really the season for being up here imagine it s most popular in spring summer early fall there t really a crowd and a lot of the are up for lease or just closed for the day I to try a within the but they were closed for the day despite their saying otherwise In any case you can enjoy a beautiful view of the lake and also take some glamour with the restaurant as the backdrop The entrance and interior dining bar is decorated fabulously with some really quirky s wax think Betty or some weird old scarecrow lady and lots of neon You can sit anywhere outside and still get that amazing view of the lake It was a bit chilly and soft drizzle of rain but it went away by the end of our dine in experience The staff were very friendly and the food actually t take long as we were it to due to the on yelp I ordered the with sweet potato and it was out of this world I got extra from my plate who ordered fish and my dad ordered a classic cheeseburger which was not bad The meat was pretty juicy despite the looking My was super tender and had a unique flavor and to my surprise extremely tasty I stuffed it with sweet potato and with ketchup and it turned out perfect for me It was a very good portion size too They serve you in souvenir that say Oasis sadly I forgot to take mine Oh yeah they also have railing on the filled with heart shaped much like the famous of love so if you are into that sort of thing don t forget to bring a padlockVery mixed here and on the Oasis Yelp page We came here on a recommendation and after reading the here and on the other Oasis page yelp biz oasis Our experience was not like the awful posted by so many We were here mid May out on a day trip with my in that recently to the area we were visiting Our experience with service was fantastic No with the food or wait times I realize that we were here at a time when were a bit than when in season That said I can say that the staff to care and were attentive If this VERY large venue had a full house I can imagine that it can be overwhelming for the floor and kitchen staff If there are here I d suspect it s management not the staff There were of us for lunch We were sat quickly and even on request no to a table away from direct sun The food was good and I no from our group It t fabulous It was good The service was great The view is fabulous The structure is immense Very cool iron art about the diver coming from the side of the building I bet this place really warm in the as the sun which I hear is amazing to watchI m only giving them a four because they charge for But everything else was good View on Lake Travis was gorgeousDONT BE BY ALL THE BAD Huge location and an even bigger parking lot If you park far there will be a complimentary shuttle that can take you to the main entrance Do yourself a favor and a few before you go trust me Make sure your phone camera is because the are breath taking Arrive early and sit on the patio If you re a smart time it right so you re enjoying dinner right before sunset since the patio the west ORDER THE FISH Maybe even stay a little while and go upstairs where the live band is and go dancing We be back for sureTake away the view and the view is INCREDIBLE the food I totally agree with Tara M If they had better food this place would rival any ocean side restaurant in S Speaking as a who lived in San I know of what I speak I had a fish which no one to do right here Berry hill comes close very close probably the Even though The Oasis is one of the few to make fish with corn and not flour flour ruin a fish I don t know why but they do it still t taste quite right No I m not a chef but yes if you re going to make a fish so yourself a favor and take a culinary trip to San origin Rest of my dining group my had the Chicken which she and my brother had the fried shrimp which he gave a resounding eh His had the Pecan Chicken Salad I think that s what it was which she really despite the mysterious orange gelatin fluff square put on the same plate maybe a brunch special it was a m Oh that me when you walk in the hostess will ask you if you want brunch or a light lunch Choose the light lunch They seat you on a higher balcony We t choose quickly enough so we were seated on Level instead of Level which is where the are even more spectacular I don t think the food would have been much different or better And the on the top level for some reason are wicker instead of plastic I guess the make up for the plastic rate but still amazing view on the positive side this is where I would have my rehearsal dinner if I ever get married NOT for the food And the gift shop is super cute with lots of unique and oh I need to get something for so and so back home kind of stuff Don t even get me on the bizarre collection of outside It s just an homage to the Keep Weird philosophy we so inexplicably hold dear to our hearts apparently it s not inexplicable My friend just read me the riot act when I read that last sentence to him All I m is can t we just be Does it have to be weird I m off topic As soon as I quit thank you for this review I have to watch my SA suck ass during Game against LA and my team is so young so if we don t win don t blame me Memorial Day Weekend feeling betterIn short everyone is pretty much right about The Oasis I went for a graduation dinner on a night We had which are a SMART IDEA if you are to go on a busy night We were seated within of during our reservation time We got a seat on the lower patio balcony area and were promptly by our waitress who nice enough Our view was quite nice for a while until just before sunrise when we were absolutely by the sun If you can try to avoid where you have full sun exposure during this time b c it s kind of brutal during the summer Anyhow I had the with pineapple I think If that you any indication the food was nothing to write home about My fish was good enough a little bland but not horrible Like someone below said I can see how paying for bland food could result in star BUT the view is really incredible it does gain some credit back And on nights they have a live band who I believe It was nice and good background for our little get together So in short go and enjoy the view chips and and the music Unless you are a serious food critic or just overly picky eat your food and just ignore the fact that you re paying for the view and the atmosphereGo for the view and do NOT expect any of the food to be good or have any flavor and view nothing more But the view is worth the trip RanchThis a rating of purely for the View of Lake Travis The restaurant is on a sheer cliff face facing the Lake and is best experienced in the light or at sunset It is The food Think Chevy s and for those of you without the joy of Chevy s think chain restaurant on par with like Chili s or but with pretty goodBig step up I was here last fall and now summer today and have been both times It s definitely a huge difference from when we still come out to bring for one of the best of Lake Travis but always for the food in advance as well as the service Invariably slow and lackluster WELL HAVE FOR THE BETTER Last fall we ate indoors and had very attentive service to our party of and today outside at our table facing the lake we with my niece and her from Michigan had a stunning view great and food AND spectacular service by who took our us on our and was professional courteous and just plain nice Our from and were pronto by Parker We never had such quick service and it t overflowing with but there were plenty The only thing for me that a Star Rating is I d love management to revise the menu keeping only the die hard Top overall ordered and re and maybe offering some lighter as well That s my wish list but said that what a huge overall improvement from ago and thanks for your attention to all your and yet still being able to photograph us You ROCKI careless for the food we came here only for the view we only ordered a huge grilled chicken and non alcohol and the view the service is friendly fast and they did put us on the table close to the water but its not in front of the view so I did the server if we can move to the table right in front of the water view and they did move our table so we got our water view table which was nice And it didnt have a long wait line like I read in a previous review well we got there a bit after lunch It s a good place to visit and out and make sure to mention if you want to sit by the water view so they will give you the table right by the water viewThe view at this place is probably worth the trip Situated at the edge of a cliff the restaurant a view of a lake The wait for a party of is on a holiday weekend We were by our family not to expect much from the food but I was pleasantly We ordered the lettuce shrimp with mango My were the and shrimp The gold margarita was good too The restaurant is huge I got lost while trying to find the There was still plenty of available tables even when there was a private event going on that day There is plenty of outside the restaurant to see while waiting for our table There is also a glass lookout to takeThe alone are five This is why you come to the Oasis This is why I come whenever I am in town because it character Yes the other about the food are accurate It is and not particularly worth it but the Oasis beautiful great and real character I could never give it because the food just t very good but it s all about that view There t many vegetarian but there are a few so up for that I usually get which are not on the menu but you can ask for them Also the chips and that come complimentary are excellent It is really good I used to always get too back in my cheese eating days In fact I have numerous of and over Lake Travis in all its various of full I was bummed to recently learn that they no longer have a priced house margarita on the menu They have switched to only the perfect margarita But like everything else you re paying extra for that view There is also a cute gift shop at this location if that is your thingHad a very large group do call ahead seating Very with our experience especially for our large group week prior to dinner ahead and about for a large group Oasis t do but does call ahead prior to dinner received call from hostess stand to confirm prior to dinner a group of us went ahead to check out our tables and make sure everything was great It was The manager was extremely patient with us as we and over inside or outside We ordered while we for the rest of our party Our server was AWESOME more on that in a bit She took our for and ahead of time She on us on the opposite side of the venue while we for our party Dinner our group up all at once took care of us so well were full came on time came out quickly came out on time were extra silverware was provided the list goes on The view we had was great some breeze some shade made for a very enjoyable dinner in Parking plenty of it There s a story garage if you are looking for covered parking Food the food was fine Everyone to enjoy the and dessertPLEASANTLY FROM SAN went for the st time yesterday and some not so nice about the well know Oasis but visiting from San i had to see for myself Truth be told the view alone was worth it The were good We ordered which are hard to mess up bacon wrapped chicken The total bill for was not bad Our waitress was GREAT Our food came out relatively quick and we were to accordingly Wish i knew her name I d definitely go backOf course the view is amazing We have been several times and have always had good service and good food My favorite is the redfish It is a great place to take out of town The whole area is so much fun to look at With everything going on at the complex it will be exciting to see it reach its full potentialView is beautiful The food is good and they have indoor and out door seating the outdoor seating right out to Lake Travis and is reallyread negative I was apprehensive about what it would be like We when it first at No wait time and our server was very friendly I ordered Beau s Plate and my sister ordered salad with chicken candied and both were excellent A friend of mine ordered the sandwich and her bacon was burned are amazing though Definitely a place forMy husband and I went to the Oasis on night and it was amazing The wait to get a table was long We about and just to check in at the hostess station and then we t get seated till about This place is well worth the wait It an amazing view of Lake Travis and the sunset was beautiful I had the and and my husband had the shrimp Both were really good and the appetizer was good as well Don t let the wait scare you away because they had stuff to do while you There is a gift shop a boot shop and an arcade along with lots of outdoor seating They had plenty of parking but you can do valet for only All in all it is a great place to goFood was good A bit spicy for my taste but really wakes up the taste spicy spicy Good food and good entertainment Live band on third floor Great from the third floorService was good Food is but it s not really about the food more the atmosphere beautiful and of Lake Travis They have live musicThe View Thats what its all about here the view The Oasis provided a laid back mellow scene for the wealthy West lake people Hosting live and providing several deck the oasis is built into the side of a cliff Lake Travis It can suck to sit outside on a business lunch in the midday sun but then again thats not really what this place is about It to shorts and with your button up or with Longhorn of course The food is good but nothing to write home about and the service is great but don t expect foot and springing to get your order in When it it Additionally they just made which I havent seen yet but I m told its bigger than before If you never been to or just visiting definitely a sight to be seenAmazing and Food was a little but recommend We received a glass souvenirWhile visiting family in we were to a sunset on Lake Travis that was comparable to that of Key West Our party as a whole felt the food was adequate The was tasty I ordered the Grilled Shrimp It was seasoned very well and perfectly The staff was attentive and very personable was our server Although we were a party of he did not add the customary gratuity for over as on the menu I understand the necessity for this policy but definitely made out betterThis place was amazing Went here for the first time and had a great time The food was nothing special but the were absolutely amazing I highly suggest this place out if you haven t alreadyI went to Oasis for the first time a couple ago and I my time The view is absolutely beautiful If nothing else I would recommend going for the view It took a little bit less than an hour to get a table but I t mind because I ended up walking around the area There s a great deal amount of parking which is great Before i went I knew the food was mediocre so I it safe and got some with beef on top which were alright The alcoholic were justIt s been my dream to come here since I saw my friend s first post about this place and ago I haven t been back to since right before my family and I to from Seeing that The Oasis currently and reading I was a bit hesitant on coming What if the food was absolutely not worth your money We would have wasted our time waiting you know People obviously come here for the I to give the food a shot We about min to be seated While waiting we around to find a perfect spot to take and enjoy the view We accomplished that task pretty quickly and I was over the heat already We went back inside and found in the a c We got seated down on the level and the first table against the edge Perfect perfect view but I was sweating the entire time There were two above us but of course with my luck they were blowing air the opposite direction When the sun to set the staff take down the At first I was like the sun But as soon as they did that I felt the light breeze come through They give water and chips shortly after you get seated I ordered beef and my ordered chicken The food is good Not amazing but still very good My ordered their spicy banana pina or whatever He said he thought he read in the menu that the cup it comes in for alcohol is complimentary not sure Four because the service was below average Our waitress forgot our water pitcher food took a while to arrive forgot our to go container and was pretty much non existent I understand it s a very busy restaurant but I d expect to have impeccable service seeing how popular the place is I would come back again thoughMe and my family went here for Mother s Day and boy was it We in the gravel since we t want to valet and Oasis was serving whoever to dine on golf to the restaurant for I don t know if that s normal for Oasis to be doing that or because it was Mother s Day The food here took some time to get to us as well as the menu but considering it was so busy that day on Mother s Day we let it slide They were also VERY accommodating to our request for us to be to another table for we got an area where there was no parasol to protect us from the glaring sun All the other were taken by other We got the and the pecan something salad for my sister I think the kitchen put more effort into their for Mother s Day but that effort was too much as my and I noted that they had seasoned the chicken with TOO much pepper The chicken and beef tasted so dry and flavorless My dad was at the sides seasoned and also noted that those were the highlight of the meal agreed Would we come back No We just came for the view and it was beautiful My and dad thought so too but not worth it to come back again I agreeSo for us I admittedly was nervous about going the sub par but we were WOW All the on us going so we did Thank God The are and worth every minute And we got the chicken which were HUGE and tasty I highly highly recommend going The only reason I t give was the menu was a tad bit small in its It all good the variety just t hugeI love the Oasis on a day when the weather is perfect and those are the only times I d recommend it It s so to sit outside with the most perfect view in IF the weather is good If you go in the heat of the summer it s just miserable I love the Fish here and get them are great I order the basic least expensive kind My only complaint is that they recently charging something like for chips and which is really irritatingA beautiful view with great food What could be better It s definitely a crowded restaurant so I d suggest getting And sitting outside I had the chicken wrap chips and and a margarita all delicious I was just in town visiting and so glad my friend took me hereI used to love this place and the are still amazing It s just not our old little Oasis but I guess not much is these days Great for and conversation not the ideal dinner destination as food is more bar food than exquisite for your palate but after a margarita the bar food t be betterThis place incredible of Lake Travis particularly at sunset The food and service were worth and I added one for the view We had hungry and two small Our waiter had plenty of hustle and did a great job taking care of us I had the pork and a Perfect Margarita and both were pretty good for fare We be coming backI have the Oasis twice once in and again last month My first experience was I came with a friend on a afternoon evening pretty sure it was a It was very busy We sat outside of the bar since that was the place available The live music from the bar was very loud and The food and service was fine and the view was good Fast forward to last month the view was truly great The service was very good the weather was perfect and we t have to sit up by the bar I came with my brother and his family and out of town on for lunch I ordered the Fire Grilled which was good I ate all of it but that s because it t huge The sun came out toward the end of our meal so they the awning where we were sitting and brought out for other tables The blocked our view of the sail on the lake but that was I would recommend visiting the Oasis and will bring my when they come to town It a beautiful view and I don t know of any other restaurant in other than the one next to the Oasis that such a nice view A garage been built and another large restaurant so it touristy tacky But at least the parking is freeYelp as closed we and were informed they were open Our intent was to stop by for the view and a drink we got both plus a good plate of shrimp and This was definitely an off time and not much was open at the complex regardless we had a Great Time and the view was worth the tripLove the Starlight Terrace with live music Don t go there for the food not that great But the Margarita is yummyI went there for the first time and was a bit disappointed due to fact that there was no outside cocktail area I did however really enjoy the virgin pina The bartender was very nice and knowledgeable of the I also had the soup of the day and chips and they were average I give this place because of the view and serviceSo this place purely on location and the taste of food but it should be ranked MUCH lower based on service While the bar service was great the table service was very poor We were seated and did not receive service for about This is after we various if we could order Once we had service everything was better but I feel like our experience would have been flawless if we t have been very hungry by the time any of our meal Plan on spending at least a conservative estimate when you come here This place is wholly unique and I recommend it on that but be ready to be patientThe Oasis Restaurant itself is situated on Lake Travis and with it s panoramic of the lake we decided to end our road trip for the day here over looking Lake Travis We decided to order several adult and some Everything from the wait staff to the view was perfect as we spent the afternoon enjoying each otherIf this review were about the food it would be no But this review is about the view which is five minus one star for the sneaky blinding sun getting in my on occasion If the Oasis the food they would be unstoppable But not the case I tried eating their a few times every time it s Additionally with the new addition the entrance like a bad Las scene But the view Oh that view That said this is my favorite place to bring out of town for and on the landscape Then we go somewhere else to eatI went to the Oasis recently with my best friend and it was absolutely beautiful Yes the food was kind of expensive and they don t split the check if that option is but the View of lake Travis is amazing It s a must seeWhile perhaps not an inspired menu the food at Oasis been consistently good for me That plus the best setting around out of the year make Oasis an easy favorite Any town worth a visit at least one if not a few really memorable to take out of who are in for a visit Oasis is definitely one of those forI give it for the free night band and and the ambience Wish there was a separate review for the food though Unremarkable and disappointingly expensive So overall a star rating Don t want to discourage people from going because it is a must see destination when you visit Lake Travis But seriously take the food up a notchBeautiful view of the sunset Definitely come here for the view The food is alright Atmosphere is awesome and love the live bandI went to catch the sunset which was an awesome view Hostess was rude but I that from previous She to seat us at a corner table blocked from any view when there was plenty of open along the side so we to switch Our waiter was great We only had which were good which was but the best part was the I would definitely come back for the view and dessertIf you are looking for a chill place to relax with good company and a view this is a great spot Food is hit or miss and I had trouble even on which entree I to order Tortilla soup was good but bowl was huge I wish it came in a smaller amount a la soup and salad There was a fan they turned on that was blowing on us really hard We could have turned it off but then it would have been incredibly hot No medium ground Sunset was nice but when we t want the sun in our the umbrella kept shifting Do they lock A good place to meet a large groupI went here for lunch on a beautiful afternoon I have absolutely nothing but positive to say about the service food and atmosphere We ordered a house salad with beef two chicken and a round of Everything came out exactly as Our server was energetic polite and thorough The manager came over himself and made sure we had water at our table as we sat down I thought the food was fresh and really tasty This was my second time at then oasis The first time we went on a for sunset and dessert We our time on as well We would definitely return to the OasisThe shrimp for where great and plenty of Good for people The view is of course amazing and honestly the where yummy and the service from our waiter was awesome the front hostess order very confused and very on organized but once we finally got seated after an hour and a half it was all smooth sailing from there Definitely worth itPeople can pick on this place all they want the truth is that of people flock to this place ever day in the peak season for a reason It s so damn beautiful It t matter WHAT you re eating Some days I go there in the dead of winter when nobody is there but Beau and his dog and I walk around in awe of the structure I the old building but the new one is just incredible Obviously it s THE place to bring out of towner s to show them and it s probably directly responsible for a couple hundred thousand moving here from all over the world I have never had bad food here even though it s not fancy or fine cuisine by any stretch of the imagination The are expensive but slam a few of tequila in the parking lot and shut the heck up I love and I love the Oasis It s one of my favorite on Earth to relax and contemplate my next adventureDon t go to the Oasis the great food and you won t be disappointed That said it s definitely worth the trip out there for the view alone So beautiful at sunset I went on a night and t have to wait at all so if the option is there go mid weekHad a wonderful experience on the th of Food was great had the with cheese The service was good as well There were being shot all over the Lake Travis horizon and they let stay as long as they to see the show well past time Have been here many times and will continue to go frequently Love this placeThis is an amazing place out in the middle of nowhere with beautiful and attractive architecture Some of my and I went on night and there was an awesome s band that had us dancing and laughing all night They are a highlight and the were priceless The and other mixed drink can get a little so per drink can add up We tried several of them and they were in plastic which was a little cheesy They were tasty but nothing spectacular The service was poor I went to order my from the bartender and he t even smile He was good looking but think he could get better if he actually like he his job At the table we had two different wait staff come by and take our and never to return with them The view is scenic and at night with the covered patio a nice openness and serenity So I think during the day is probably better to go as then the will be open and you can see what s out there to view of the lake and landscape The sunset I m sure is spectacular It s mainly an crowd They have valet parking or plenty of to park yourself thats not too far away and also a covered parking garageWent back for lunch recently no the service were both great and of course the view is phenomenalstar for the sunset We at around got in line in time to get a table for the sunset view before sunset It was a so it was quite chaotic the cheesy sun were everywhere the sun was right in my face by the for but don t get and let that ruin your mood The and t the and they seem to be rushing to have you seated and to take your it was a busy day so t expect much Our server was diligent So for them for the food not a big food critic chips came warm and crispy were quite tasty and the margarita was strong the Sunset Food did take a while but we were on the chips and on our so it s alright About before sunset the removing the the place instantly and the view was beautifulMy husband took my mother in law my mother my daughter and me to the Oasis We were seated outside on the patio Lake Travis The view really was lovely Our waitress was nice and did a good job of taking our and making sure everyone was happy The outside were to best block the sun from our and to keep my baby shaded We all had good I can t even remember what I ordered but it sure was good The sunset was spectacular I my visit and I t mind being taken againGreat patio sunset watching venue in Fun bar food to pair with your favorite libation great place to On the list of to do when inOasis oh such bittersweet considering i went with my EX squash Regardless all i can say is with that view of Lake Travis U end up not really about the food the view atmosphere when the sun is setting is awesome romantic serene nice place to go on a date well as for the food it was nothing spectacular but its nice the are good nice with the amount of people there expect ur waiter to forget something u for of ago But overall its a nice concept I would visit again when i m inThe food was pretty good not amazing but yummy This is definitely a place to come with the view is amazing and the overall is very fun and casual We went for lunch in the middle of summer so it was HOT Unfortunately the weak provided no help Our waiter had a relatively sour personality but he got the job done I would come back here for the overall experienceMy take is that The Oasis is a good place to get lunch or dinner if your a tourist visiting Come by Lake Travis and have a bite to eat on the deck and get yourself a great view of the lake while some cuisine Get some chips and an Ice tea or The food is pretty good I d definitely come back when I m in town It s not gourmet food but a step up from your typical chain like OutbackBeautiful view Lots of cool nearby like beer and ice cream Food was actually pretty good were strong and tasty Very fun spotThis is must come one time tourist visit for sure Living here as a local you don t much appreciate paying for the view and only the food Food is lackluster but the alcohol that Service is phenomenal for how many they have running around at once and the Truly beautiful place to visit and chill potentially even catch a live band they do lack on bar staff during but rarely do you have the bar backed up making over between guess the band too much as Seriously view or music don t come for the food but still a great place for a date or family to see the lake in its sunset gloryand were annoying but when they were gone AMAZING sunset view My chicken salad was so salty that it was inedible BUT they immediately it with a regular grill chicken salad Our server was very nice and accommodatingSitting outside during a summer usually in heat exhaustion However The Oasis patio over looking Lake Travis is with huge and a system Despite a temperature our party of spent a few enjoying the scenery companionship and food The hostess set our big party in a secluded area perfect for a reunion Our waiter was excellent and handled our large party without delay The food was good and priced well I recommend the fish My wife the shrimp We also ordered a few the fish dinner and a few Our were generally very good The was the exception tasting more like cardboard Overall this is certainly a place we head back too While its a minute drive from the heart of its winding and beautiful lake help make the experienceDefinitely come here for the sunset view over Lake Travis and to enjoy some good music There is some amazing art work throughout the restaurant grounds so it is a nice place to take a walk after you eat There are usually some local selling their on the so bring some cash if you appreciate art jewelry and or nick you re to find something you likeFood was you re honestly just coming for the view The server we had was awesome But NONE of the arcade work next doorThe view what can I say awesome even with the lake less than half full I always get the lettuce chicken too good A glass of wine and sunset what else could I ask for nothing I could think ofI am rating this restaurant four on the amazing view Check on their for the time of the sunset If you sit on the veranda over looking lake travis you can view the most gorgeous sunset Heat a cozy experience in the winter The restaurant s interior needs a little The food is It is average in appeal and priceYou may get addicted to the view of the sunset from the level deck Great atmosphere and food Wish they had more of a beer selection Brewery attached and they don t serve the beer If you make it to lake Travis you really should stop for dinner and the sunsetThis place such an amazing view So beautiful at sunset I ordered the strawberry margarita and felt awesome when I was carded Then my waiter said he was from my home state of Go Great service I ordered the It was t great t amazing that it had avocado on it This is definitely a place more for the view than the food I would come back againI good food and magnificent scenery I ate baby back It was really tasty and spicy I could see a beautiful sunset on the lakeGood food and service with an incredible view I was visiting in the area who chose the Oasis for an evening together We ate outside after sunset and thoroughly the view atmosphere and the food The food arrival was a bit slow so instead of The wait staff were very friendly and for the The owner came to the table and himself and for a bit It was nice that he took some time instead of just by with a how is everything and not really about the answer Kudos to BeauMy SO took me here for a sunset dinner and I truly our experience at The Oasis We came on a and were seated promptly at a table with an incredible view of Lake Travis The music was and our server was attentive with us as he checked on us multiple times to make sure we were enjoying our dinner We for a platter of the with shrimp and chicken The chicken was grilled just right and we ultimately had food leftover was kind enough to bring me a considerable amount of to go to store it all He also took a picture of us with the view at sunset which I I truly had a lovely time here and it that other were enjoying themselves tooFull for ambience and location The place is so crowded that your order may take a lot of time We had to wait before food was on our table Since it was sunset time and atmosphere was so great we t mind waiting and lots of Food is good too We ordered and they tasted just fine Go there only if you have lot of time in hand or with a prior reservation specially onDefinitely come here for the gorgeous view However the food is not good I would probably come for the view and to grab a fewFirst time to visit the Oasis and I was Great view of Lake Travis and the lettuce were great Had a wonderful taste to them I read some of the less than complimentary and the only thing I can assume is that the food service once the Oasis after the fire Great place to sit outside and have a casual Thought the were in line as well Will go back next time I am inFriendly staff descent food and a Beautiful view Got a really good table out on the patio on a beautiful day I love that they have on almost all of he tables on the patio so that you t like an egg while enjoying your food and the The hostess stand it right with the seating system that they have I love it no matter how busy they are you wont t have to wait very long The food is fair nothing to run home about or a must try and the are a bit I think you pay for the view of Lake Travis but they work the cost into the menu not worth the but the view is I will definitely be back There s a gift shop valet parking or you can park across the street they have a shuttle service that goes back and forth from the parking lost to theOur company does a special conference every summer in We usually have dinner at a restaurant near our hotel but this time we venture out to The Oasis And we were so glad we did The location is wonderful the food delicious and the service and atmosphere were great for the price is very reasonable are freshGreat view food friendly helpful service Get there for sunset have a margarita and enjoy the view Food was good but I can t say fantastic Would definitely go back good place for a datethe oasis at lunch the lake is really low it still was nice the fish toco sAwesome and atmosphere for Yes yes the food again is not the reason you come here and I think the know that The were reasonably priced though and we had a plate of that was satisfactory It had lots of chips the But it was nothing that will blow your mind This place is typical of you find in Lake or in Big Bear Lake CA its all about the and being near the water than it is enjoying an gourmand dining experience Our server was great and speedy which is something we were not based on other It was a night at and the place was pretty We really the fact that we could just go straight to the floor to the bar and order food without waiting to be seated in the restaurant They also had a pretty decent band too it was a good experience the music Would go back just for thoseThe view is it s a must have Mother s Day brunch was terrific great service wonderful food selection The sunset and the view is worse the high cost on non holiday menuThere s really not much I can add to the Oasis But here s my take Come in the afternoon Stay for the sunset Order Pay way too much for them Eat chips and Pay way too much for and or to supplement the so so Enjoy the view Smile RepeatWe are from New York and this restaurant was by a friend in the area The view and sunset was amazing We found it to be very informal and inexpensive with the food delicious and service was customer friendly We went back another night to find a band along with dancing It was a most enjoyableFood is decent The view is AMAZING Very nice place to go on a date Decent The are good and the staff was friendly There are some small yellow that are annoying and sometimes get in your drink though which is annoyingI love new people to the Oasis It s a great view and decent to relax in the sun The drive out here is beautiful as well However I will say when we went most recently they seated us in probably the only place on the patio without an umbrella and no fan action We were boiling I t even want to finish my frozen margarita Way too hot Our waiter hardly came around too so we t even bother for a seat change Every other time been fantastic though I just won t be in the dead heat of summerGo for the view and I can t say enough about the amazing sunset The food is average The are decent and the service is BUT that view and getting to out with and The Oasis a must and incredible experienceI love to go to the Oasis during sunset I have so many of the sunset The different are unique the music is cool I really enjoy walking around the area on nights because it is quiet peacefulBefore moving to I multiple times and fell in love with it Being a vegetarian it is never hard to find something to eat The are good and service is timely and proper we have family over you can be sure that we will be there It is a great location and the view is exceptional It is a great place to take a date Last date I had there we had a wonderful dinner and a walk at up Overall I am a fan and will visit againDespite all the bad we decided to risk coming here even just for the view We were pleasantly that we got great service great food and of course great We were seated in less than Our server was very friendly and attentive And we the free chips and Both the chicken and shrimp were good shrimp a bit at for a plate of shrimp and the tortilla soup was good too The food came out very quickly maybe from when we ordered the and my Corona rita too We came at around before the got crazyBased on all the previous I assume this place is a hit or miss I came with a group of and we were seated immediately since we chose to sit outside The view is what this restaurant It s an amazing view of lake Travis After our group sat down we were quickly be our server and later water and chips w I had the chicken and beef which were really good They came out hot and fresh I honestly can t find one thing to complain about in to my food My other who had did mention that their food was a bit regular for the price that s why I m giving it Overall I would come again just for the viewThe only downside to our dinner was the wait We had a hour wait to be seated Then an hour wait to get our food But I must share this the setting looking out over Lake Travis as the sun slowly set all of God s colors the serenity the peace I felt in my heart well worth the wait Then the food Hot and delicious Though the waiter about the delay he t have to as far as I m concerned We had a great night and a wonderful meal Thank you OasisI m giving four instead of three because as we were to depart in a dramatic flourish of our server brought us not one not two not three not four not five but SIX plastic Oasis souvenir Take heed all ye work forsooth But objectively this place really does deserve three It s all right don t get me wrong the food was just how shall I put it sort of creditably unremarkable Edible but forgettable Fit for consumption My wife and I went here not too long ago and honestly I don t even remember what we got So that you I THINK I got the spicy chicken sandwich I THINK my wife got some salad or something There were stale chips and involved at one point as I recall Whatever The view looking out over Lake Travis is definitely great my goodness Eat out on the deck if you go otherwise there s no point In summation somewhat enjoyable but ultimately probably not worth your time Quite like the s band of the same namebeautiful view good live music great Average food I would come back for entertainment not for eatingFirst visit since the original restaurant burned down Much more of a touristy location now Complimentary chips and well prepared homemade Ordered the chicken hatch child plate were very well prepared and the chicken was moist it just some heat rice and were disappointing the taste was not one of when those sides Our waitress was great However it is the scenic overview of Lake Travis and the photo in and around the restaurant that make it a great dining experienceOH MY GOD Where do I start My sister and brother in law chose Oasis for their rehearsal dinner spot The location view and overall of this place however the service is TRICKY Get there early don t even try to make a reservation because they don t take them If you arrive your entire party must be present or you won t get seated It t like they are hurting for this place is HUGE HUGE HUGE and until Don t do what I did and arrive we got seated almost two later and t eating until almost Come for the ambience live music and of course the view Don t expect the food to be gourmet P S See that giant palace next door that like it can t possibly be a home but it is Yeah that s the owner s house He there alone That s the crazy I LOVE to hearThe view is spectacular making the commoner feel like a million really in fact it is the only public special place in that that awe feeling that only or the grand canyon can give one person Now the food is as average as at the service is from the trying to save up for gas money and the drive is just as long as the walk from the parking lot Still the view is worth the trouble the cheap food that will go down a lot better if you order a double jackThis place for the view on its own Such a place for lunch or dinner Food is good but nothing spectacular however we came for lunch so it s finger food for the most part I had the brisket sandwich which I do recommend I would come back againI don t care how mediocre the food is how there is a dollar adder to every dish and how touristy this place can be The atmosphere and drive to this wondrous location relaxation in my The Oasis daydreamer is a tasty and drink be sure to get one if it is your first time You are going there to enjoy the sunset and chill out don t gripe too much about the food since you know what you are getting into Craw fish are Pork have a unique taste beware Crispy Shrimp feature about large to jumbo but are better then the Fried shrimpThe food was pretty good and the view was amazing especially during sunset Food was at our table pretty quick Live band was a nice touch The server we had was not very attentive We half hour for our check Overall our experience wasDefinitely the best sunset view in The wait was long but worth the wait t like that the directly on our table The food was average I would recommend Oasis to family in for the viewCame here with my family today and it was amazing We had a gloomy day but the food made up for it They first brought out chips and and the was great good mix of spicy to it The was good also I got the cheese enchilada and substituted the chili sauce for the hatch chile sour cream sauce and it was very delicious The margarita was a great The view definitely the trip to the restaurant worth it We had a good time and the food and view Definitely will go back again when we re in the areaI understand the stress of constantly being with tables from the of how busy it there Everything was great but I t happy with the attitude my server had I d assume you would give everyone great service and always have a smile She cut everything short and I did feel rushed with everything that was going on Food was great and I m glad I chose to come to to enjoy some with everyoneSpectacular view of Lake Travis Atmosphere is so fun Food is pretty good as well Amazing chips andThe Oasis is one of my favorite in which is not an easy feat since is full of great I always sit on the outside dining deck even during the middle of summer because the are amazing It is not uncomfortably hot as you might expect because there are plenty of and to block the sun There is always plenty of parking available and there is usually someone who will drive you to your car from the entrance of the restaurant I would definitely recommend this place to and alikeLunch was great This place is huge Free parking available The view was inspiring Food service was good Due the sun we were a different table Food was good taste good Nice experienceIt was good but the service was perfect It was beautiful at sunset was super for the size you getFood was but the were spectacular Will definitely go backThere was practically no wait we for a table with a great view which we received The service was great the service was great all were very friendly especially the hostess Food and were a little but then again remember you re also paying for the atmosphere and the view Our waiter also was very mindful of where the Sun was in the placement of our Twice during dinner he made sure that we t out in the Sun I say we but also the other Their staff was very well accommodatingOasis food is amazing it s easy to sit down i recommend not to go to oasis on but go before sunset so you can sit down and enjoy the sunset while eating it s to die forSAVED BY THE VIEW The food was average but the view was definitely not average I have never been to a restaurant where they can t cut the off the and just leave the bell I was only told this fact after the to my table and the waitress went back to correct the order She came back to our table and told us that it was not possible Did I mention the are amazing Despite all the waitress was friendly and attentive The only way to experience a hurricane in is to have one at the Oasis The are strong and in a commemorative glass Still we the experience and if you have never been then definitely worth the trip Overall the hilltop will keep us coming back to this destination time and time againIts that so many gave this place bad I guess its cause they are it to the they always hear Anyway I have been coming here pretty much every year except when it burnt since during the ROT rally Since I always came during ROT rally weekend I thought that s why the service but I guess not I just like the out side deck atmosphere and the be honest tho never knew this place was known for the and I never anyone clap there during the sunset Nor anyone ever made any deal about it when I been there I like N better I don t remember the food really so I guess it t awesome but t badCome here for the view and you leave a happy camper The Oasis me of a mythical castle suspended above the and the lake like a fortress A on Lake Travis if you will Go simply to experience one of the most of almost any restaurant I ever seen There are over tables at this place down the restaurant I ever seen when you drive by you may mistake the Oasis for a casino resort as I did Think again Like Amy B the food here was not outstanding and was rather over priced for an entree for roughly the quality of your average Red Robin I guess you really are paying for the spectacular Their however are quite good and will satisfy ever the biggest margarita Their Gold and Guava are the best I The Oasis after taking a red eye the previous night into As a first time visitor to the state of and the city of I was blown away by the natural beauty of Lake Travis and the stunning location of The Oasis After a day s lounging on the beach The Oasis will hit the spot even though it s food is somewhat unremarkablelandmark The food is mediocre but the atmosphere more than up for the food Best place for this side of theThe view is amazing and the food is pretty good We stick to the and fish and those always come out well The wait staff is very friendly and attentive This place for a good date as wellGreat view and really good food Fried shrimp were perfect Fish a big hit too For the is really good Our server was a little on the slow side but I have eaten here several times and it always been great This time we did find food on our when we took them out of the clothAwesome Great environment Good food Must see for and aloneThe Oasis is all about the view People may say my husband included that the food is mediocre but I always get the Grilled Shrimp and it never disappointed me the experience and we take our here too and they love the experienceI went here at an off time mid week and mid afternoon but the service and food were very good The view is beautiful and worth the experience alone Our waitress was friendly and happy to answer my about the area and the mystery orange fluff they serve as a side dishThey need more on the menu The view is amazing They need more heating outside in the cold and more in the summerThe view the sunset the rita the company you have with you Each a starWe came on the night of some anniversary celebration or something It was extremely busy and lively but we got lucky and snagged a table with a great view of the sunset Food and service were mediocre though we probably got the best service they could manage between the crowd and the It was worth it for the sunset however and I would give it at least one more try on a less busy nightWe recently had a company th Anniversary Party at the Oasis in the Lone Star Room our with the Oasis food off their special menu which included Shrimp s Chicken s Roosted Hatch Green Chili Chicken Chili Con Tenderloin Tomato Chicken Fruit and and no event in would be complete without Chips and The only item I was not a fan of was the Tenderloin Tomato but everything else was very impressive The room our quite well The view as always was superb and even with the cloud coverage from passing it left a gorgeous backdrop for the event Our were to perform on the patio Lake Travis which was the Grand Finale to this great event If you re an event as we did I would suggest a minimum of We were only given one bartender which a long and lengthy line for the thirsty but all in all it turned out wellGreat place to take out of town The are stunning Their food while certainly not the best around hunger and fine The are their best offering in my opinion I took my wife here on a date the day we got engaged so hopefully that my confidence the view will make up for the slight in the food It crowded near sunset so arrive fairly early to get a seat Personally I feel the are also great for lunch time or on cloudy days toofood view atmosphere service and staff on this trip I seen worse previously but GREAT job this time to visiting the Oasis It s all about timing In the summer you must arrive by no wait at the latest plan on at your table until the sun goes down If you arrive around you are going to wait in line to get on the list for a table around then the list line will be a hour wait depending on how far off sunset is The wait time difference is SIGNIFICANT depending on when you arrive Bring good family this place is a GREAT place to sit back and relax and catch up with Don t bring impatient people who don t like to linger over a meal Don t drink the on the Even the suggest the frozen befriend the bartender in the lower level bar it s Don t valet park and do the shuttle if you don t want to walk Order generic food Read the I personally have never had a bad here but I would suggest steering clear of the food The oasis is not known for their food Remember you are going there for the VIEW and the ATMOSPHERE Please remember this is a fantastic place to people watch statue watch weird look at the view chill with your and family shop for lovely jewelry oh wait got caught up in the oasis moment It will seem like Sea World when you approach but remember there are inside don t be And most importantly TIMING TIMING TIMING If you don t want to wait get there during the s hour as I call the oclock dining hour I personally am an operational manager I d love to take the management over just to help streamline the people herding but if you can set that aside easy to do then you won t mind the strange of to get into line it like you are living a pattern Oasis staff way to go I had fantastic service this last trip probably to different staff and every one was fantasticly helpful Much from previousI have been to the Oasis on several I try to hit off times to avoid the wait and it worked well for me on most I enjoy the view but the food is really barely on the good side of average My reason for my review rating was the excellent wait staff I had on my last visit Our lunch was taking too long so he gave us free chips and During lunch I a horrible cough attack he stopped what he was doing to see if I anything He me but I declined later he with hot tea with local honey and told me that it his Very kind and very I wish I would have caught his name but I was trying to get out of the without disturbing other with my Again not a fan of the food but love the view and the I will be backAfter reading the negative I was apprehensive with going to Oasis However we were pleasantly The food and were good Yes it s a bit however let s face it you re paying for the view and ambience like you would with any other restaurant The service was good our waitress did not rush us especially since the expectation is that you stay for the sunset It was sweet that the Oasis a daily ritual for the to ring the bell before sunset Overall we had a positive experience there and will go backI think I found the place where bronze go to die Seriously though if you are coming here for the you are missing the point The star attraction here t the food service or music it s the view of Lake Travis sprawling below you should take note of Service on a late lunch was good and attentive Our server Mary was friendly and quick Food was quickly brought to the outdoor terrace table and my sis and her husband both live in the area and were here fire said the food was much better and a menu than what was before the fire A lightning strike a fire a while back and the restaurant was rebuilt The menu we had ranged from tortilla soup to battered chicken with a ranch dip to fish I d say overall it was on par with or exceeding a chain restaurant s Apparently this is a very busy place on when are and they host dancing as by the large parking lots surrounding the venue So accordingly I would not be amazed if the service was or harder to get a table during peak as would many during a peak hour on a weekend Overall it is nice to find a good reasonably priced restaurant with outdoor dining that t leave you staring into a Target an office park or the backside of a movieHad mixed of this place but the food was great obviously the view made it even better HOWEVER our server t spent nearly enough time in the hospitality business as our table of four Long story short I her if it was possible to do a skinny margarita with a grand mariner floater They had a skinny rita on the menu and also an option to add a floater to their regular margarita so what the hell is the difference She was QUICK to shut that idea down and that everything was made so that t an option Again made no sense and thought it was totally bizarre to not at the very least PRETEND to walk away and ask the bar manager whoever if they could do that And I probably t be telling that the are made either especially when they t thank goodness So naturally the second she away to place our food order I walk up to the bartender myself order my drink and get EXACTLY what I without any hesitation whatsoever and made sure to take care of him for providing solid customer service Thank you for saving my lunch experience Our group will be back because of you and will be sitting at the barThe and I have been here twice over the last year Both times we were presently despite the negative The and good the guava margarita is awesome The food was actually really good we the bison with cheese t even finish it The service was also pretty darn quick for being on th The As you can tell from above The are such that you can share The are tiny and small and were with staff The paying had to wait while the staff used the looI feel like I need to show The Oasis some love Poor thing This was my time here the first time was actually in the evening during the dark so I t see much I brought my sister and her family here since it was their first time in and even though it was busy there t a long wait The view was great and I even their margarita and The Oasis is such a great place for first to or even I hope that they keep improving on the foodTacky restaurant with amazing of Lake Travis which the cheesy completely worth it We went for in and I got to watch an amazing sunset while sitting outdoors The and all taste commercial but the is fresh and the chips are crispy A great spot for large with or withoutWe recently got dragged here for a family event In the past we found the here to be great but the food and experience were decidedly poor We really plastic cheap for expensive Well all that The food was better than average and they used glass glasses for We were really no longer a gorgeous embarrassment Worth a visit nowI really the view and the live band on the terrace level I would recommend early as parking is a bit of a challenge Food was decent nothing special but tasty The were really good Food and drink Service atI was in town for a quick business trip and someone in our group had some prior experience eating here at the Oasis It was great for our needs to discuss business informally and have a good dinner and Besides the which are outstanding the take away is the service which for us was unbelievably good They kept if everything was and we the check For my part I had the chicken and I them to put cheese on them which they did Wow they were tasty but I really left the restaurant full I ate way too much but it I would gladly come back here for the alone but the food was good and I it I especially the casual atmosphere Be aware that the menu is not a large but I cannot see anyone not finding something on it that they t enjoy If re in town on business try this place You will enjoy itGreat of Lake Travis at this location I got a spicy chicken sandwich and it s slightly above average The chips and are very good as was the They have your basic run of the mill island style frozen Nothing in the section that really out I would strongly recommend out the on a beautiful dayVery impressive Casual atmosphere great food and the VIEW They have live music in the evening and the staff was friendly as well We were seated very quickly and just our whole timeI m writing this experience based on our visit which t incluse much food Seeing as though this is a restaurant we would want really great food but through and other Yelp we decided to go for a drink and a snack simply for the view My husband and I for a month while on our year long US tour and saw what a great view this place had so we both got a margarita chips and and I got a soup We went at sunset and it was so beautiful Our server was very nice and fast so we cannot complain about anything My guess is if this place the menu to include new and this place would be an absolute one of a kind The view itself is amazing now if it had the quality of food to match it will continue being a gold mine Feel free to check out my travel atDefinitely a place for the view The spicy chicken sandwich is pretty good and so are the chicken were so soFood was were but the view and drive are amazing The and are what you come for but none of it you really stay for We came on a so easy seating on the floor It t take much for them to get View check Polite timely waiter check not bad so check The food though Eh We ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwich and Hatch Chili Chicken and the chicken tasted and felt like it was grilled the day before and then You could tell the flavor may have once been there but now it was dry and rubbery The were good great chips and but the main part the chicken was a let down This is a part that can change so hopefully their management through these and accordingly As a restaurant the food is the priority the view is just the luxury that you can add onto the price I d honestly have rather brought a Jack in the Box chicken sandwich and just orderedI love the here and our out of town always enjoy it However we always warn them that the food t the best Unfortunately it s almost always cold I understand the with but it is definitely a problem they need to solve Maybe on the food or something not sure their problem We keep going because we love the If the food I d give it aGreat space set on some prime property It was quite the trek to get up here but we had a good time We sat in the starlight lounge and there was a great band Theres a dance floor and huge outside patio We came here for the sunset and We only chips and so I can t say much about the food Overall it s a great place to bring people from out of town like myself The service is very spotty thoughFood is View and a atmosphere make up for it An landmark You must not miss itVery Cool Place Beautiful and everywhere Neat lighting and water too Amazing view of nice on low Lake Travis and superb sunset The food was nothing memorable or amazing Margarita was blah I will be back again because of the place and view There is also a and Sea Food Place there might give the a shot like if they in better chef to develop a nice menu they would be I have never been here when it is so not sure if they even seat to capacity Place is HugeYou don t go to the Oasis for the food you go for the view The restaurant is built as a series of to maximize the view especially at sunset I recommend the sunset time in your weather application and showing up some There are a number of interesting around the restaurant a concert party terrace and another restaurant Soleil that pretty good food but was closed this time The food was We had the My daughter had the which was slightly above average They have good and a good selection of beer Service is quite good too We had the for dessert courtesy of the restaurant because of a birthday and they were delicious If we were not so full we would have ordered more You must try them Next time we might just order and dessertI love the stuffed avocado appetizer and came in amount than we from the price View of the lake is awesome but better to sit near window only coz it s too hot outside So the choice is to come for dinner and enjoy the sunset outsideThis star rating is for the service and location and NOT the food to be very clear We were recently responsible for conspiring with my friend s to bring her to The Oasis for dinner except it was to be a surprise wedding proposal for her The food always been average but I was over by the table they for us right at the top and the staff went above and beyond to make this event truly special A special thanks to the manager for helping orchestrate everything perfectlyMy and I had a great time at the Oasis were amazing The sun is staring right at you so you have to play around with the if you sit outside Staff was friendly and other were as well We took everybody s recommendation and just had and and a small bite to eat afterwards somewhere else A local couple was sitting next to us and had the same plan They have a drink limit on the hurricane due to its supposedly alcohol content We t think it was strong at all No one else around us had it so that t the best value was excellent although a bit steep at Overall had a good time Would go back againsolid This would be a GREAT venue for a large wedding party or huge event Unfortunately if you re a this place is pretty vacant of the here have left and it is like a ghost town like what the other have said However come for the gorgeous viewGo there for the music view not for the food Wish they would make the food less bland It not bad but it s not amazing etherI first came to the Oasis in It was quaint a little touristy the view always amazing but the food bit the big one I keep trying every couple of and this time was by far superior They have done so much work on the place it is starting to look like a little city an Oasis Good for them Now it s big and touristy but very cool especially the candy store with the salt water taffy very soft The food was much better We had a table full of we ordered every appetizer on the menu The best was the fried avocado and then the WONDERFUL Other than that everything else was nothing spectacular We were to full to order or We just to get to know I get the feeling they are just up for something much bigger and better and I think they are on the right path Now that they a joint and a place in the same little Oasis area I have so much more to try Very cool stuffThis is the only restaurant I ever gone where my steak is perfectly Love the and really the view Service wasGreat view were good was great t get a chance to eat but the we did tryONLY because the view is spectacular and on a nice day it s the perfect place to sit outside and have a drink and chips and If good food and good service are important to you this is not the place I like the complimentary chips and We split beef and they were not good edible but not tasty The food typically a very long time to come out but the are apparently made in a different kitchen and came out very quickly Will we be back Yes because of the viewGreat spot for cheap and a view of the lake Per other we t eat here but in a few each and took in some vitamin d from the patio Service was great were good No hereI love this place The atmosphere and the view is amazing Being here during make me love life Yeah it s that good The food is decent but nothing to write home about I had the Shrimp and it was good The on the other hand was not impressive I really hope they change the recipe I kind of regret it This place is a must while inThe view lake travis is The was good and was good Service was o kI should qualify this statement by saying that I am a HUGE fan of nights with dancing I will come week after week to enjoy the Brew and the mango I never really eat the food are good enough when you re on the most of the time place during the warm summer so be sure to check the schedule on Oasis s So funBest scenery in for a place to eat Attentive wait staff and really good Food is not the best but the atmosphere more than up for it We live in and drive here to times a yearThis is one of the main where we take our out of town The view and eclectic atmosphere are great Great opportunity to take fun The food is reasonable I think everyone should experience this place at least onceI am so excited my took us to this restaurant The view was absolutely amazing It was so hot but sitting outside was fine everywhere to keep everyone cool The server was nice and got us our food in a timely manner however she t answer basic about the menu The drink I ordered was so delicious as well as the foodThe Oasis is like your short list of for those who are either visiting or just to This is a very big venue with lots of to see and do eating drinking listening to live music and shopping I really like the drinking and listening to the live music The food is really good and plentiful You won t leave hungry here When visiting during their normal peak times expect a wait and sometimes you will have to hunt down your wait staff personnel Because it really get busy there People love to sit outside and see the sunset Great place for large and small I visit this place about times with no orA great place to take visiting from out of town for a beautiful view of the lake The food is not the best in town but it is good and the lake up for anything itYou come for the gorgeous scenery and everything else is part of that experience Reading in advance I knew to anticipate an hour or more wait Essentially there are two Dinner one before sunset and one after sunset The people who come before sunset get in over an hour before sunset the people who get seated after sunset may come in before sunset but will linger with a drink around the property while sunset and then sit for dinner after the sun set and the first crowd left Just plan to have a two part experience if you don t get in the first seating The were super fast out of the kitchen within min and about min faster than an order of and which is highly unusual and something the kitchen can try to figure out how to manage better The server us that the would be very fast and to put the in first so he already let us know the order might be off We had and the chicken was well seasoned and the sides were fresh with warm flour The beef was a bit chewy and tough The white chips were the and for some reason the blue chips did not seem fresh the and were good other than the less than fresh chips The margarita with floater was perfect and everything else about the experience was greatPretty decent food friendly service and amazing A must try if you re in Be prepared to get there early or have a long wait in peak They have indoor seating but try the patio you re there for the anyway rightGreat and an awesome atmosphere A terrific spot to check out if you are in from out of town We sat down just in time to watch the sunset over the reservoir it was an experience to say the least Food is pretty good order and a margarita and call it a night The is also first rateEat before you go and bring something in a purse or camera case to spike the Then enjoy the sunset After that go upstairs for the live music seasonal It will be hot in the Summertime until the sun goes down but it s breezy in the and it can be perfect Waiting for a table in the heat can suck Don t do it Go instead to on Bend for early or s Bistro in Ranch and then try the Oasis afterward Out of town will appreciate your effort Unfortunately they kick the band out at even if the dance floor is By this time everyone s figured out that the are alcohol free I gave it because some of those Summer with the breeze the music and the make me feel like I am on vacationObviously the Go To Lake Travis restaurant I remember going to the Oasis as a every time we That was before the fire rebuild I remember it being However I am writing this review as an adult so unfortunately all the the many of to play hide seek on are not what I m this by My are broken down into for the alone STAR for the amazing staff that literally like round trip from the kitchen to my table to bring me an extra side of Ranch then again round trip for a side plate because I m basic don t like the taste of Ranch in a plastic ramekin for the food Sum it up Great Atmosphere since everyone is mostly there for a party on vacation or entertaining out of town Most amazing view in besides Mount which t have so Oasis best Food is mediocre at best are The Bright Side It t really matter because if you live in YOU WILL spend your money here When you live in everyone you know want to visit you this is the impressive place to take them Just suck it up drink your Margarita frozen chicken into a fryer enjoy that sunset It really does take your breathe awayI don t understand why the low but all I can say is that this is a must come place when visiting or even just a great place to come out when you just want to relax and get away from it all amazing view of lake Travis and the food and were not too bad it is a bit but it should be we ordered the margarita and pina and they were both very refreshing especially on a degree day we also got the chicken avocado salad as well as complementary chips n service was alright as we for someone to get our order but after that it was fineWe came here for dinner on my second night in town There was a wait for outside but we were seated within We got there right at sunset the view was spectacular as We got the fried avocado appetizer it was awesome It was warm crunchy on the outside smooth on the inside I got the stuffed avocado for my entree was equally happy I also tried my friend s pork my other friend s chicken I was with both Perhaps we just chose wisely It was but I was on vacation so I t mind The service was also fine We were there to take in the view have a leisurely dinner Nothing about the service stood out as horrible Overall I thought it was a nice place to out chill for a fewI love their live music every However if they change their workshop toward the beginning of the night will keep everyone energy going The food is alright However their kitchen closed at so we did not order the last item Well I will come back for musicWhat a view This place is as were very good and so was our meal A little but completely because of the beautiful backdrop The were great I did the combination chicken and pork The vegetable assortment was basic but the pork had a great flavorThe are spectacular Just grab a drink and head to the section below it closed but you re to take your and there and watch the sunsetAmazing amazing view of the lake restaurant somewhat like a castle and the food is decently good You do have to wait a little bit longer you d expect toI agree that this place is a tourist trap and that this place is only in the food department but the sunset was amazing the was fun and chill and very and the reasonable I had a great time so that s worthy of four for sureThere were six of us evening First impression on the road approaching Oasis is how big a venue the place is Parking lot was but there was shuttle service to the entrance For a evening there were a lot of people Wait time as was a little over an hour Bronze at the entrance were very impressive During our wait time we around to the different and and from the gift shop Jewelry and from a local artist were noteworthy In that we before sunset we to take some good Overall food and service were acceptable considering this cliffside establishment is primarily a tourist attraction We chose the and t disappointed Our server was very attentive throughoutChips and were good Shrimp and green chili was amazing The view is breath taking and service was friendly I had no at the restaurant at allFirst time here and we were just that the the view would live up to everything we and it sure did They have a good amount of parking and even have a shuttle to the place When you get closer you can see that this place is huge I t even get to the brewery side The wait is long so plan ahead You can not call ahead it s first come first serve so just know you will be hanging out before being seated they have a bar gift shop very cute must go in and check out all the stuff and brewery so this is however no food is at the bar Wish they had at least some like chips and or something while you have a drink But anyways so when you walk up they have staff everywhere so you can ask and they reach out to help guide you You get in line to make a reservation which they take on and then wait until you get a text telling you to go to the hostess desk to be seated We were seated outside and it was hot for awhile but it is nice that they do everything they can to block the sun for you We sat down and ordered The Oasis Daydreamer was amazing Would reorder in a heartbeat And you get to keep the glass Our waiter Blake was amazing and even brought us clean glasses at the end so we could take them home and not have them sticky from our When we ordered Blake was more than helpful as we tried to find out what we to eat He told us everything that was amazing and it sure lead us into making the right decision Some have said that the food is not that great This made me skeptical about for dinner but I think it s really you just need to know what is good to order and what is just sub par My friend got the brisket sandwich and I had the shrimp Both were good and I would order them again The shrimp was perfect and had good flavor As for the view it was amazing It lived up to the talk After the sun goes down the weather is perfect You could see the house from where we were sitting Our waiter also was very awesome at us about the area about the owner which was nice to hear about since we knew nothing about the place Will definitely be and would ask for Blake if we have the optionPerhaps the view you are going to get in Lake Travis try to get there around sunset it is awesome Food is solid huge and pretty much all high quality were really good tooI love coming here every time I m in parking and wait There will always be a wait to get here at around sunset but it s usually half the time that they say Meanwhile you can enjoy the and watch the sun set Alternatively you could grab an appetizer at the Brewing and wait there since you receive a text when your table is ready I highly recommend valet it s not worth the time or frustration to park though there is now a parking structure View and The view can only be beat by The are very good I had the Spicy Banana YES I have never had a bad experience with the food I think might expect a star triple diamond experience but this place is very clearly an outdoor space with a great view There is a variety ofThe food is average What out are the amazing Eating lunch or dinner t be more The are helpful and oblige taking The live music in the evening a whole new charm to the place The bar is well with a wide range of A must see at least once if not for the food then for the ambience and thethis is weird Why is this place I came here so I was a tourist and t help but and I know I say this a lot fall in love The view is incredible Their set up along the cliff is perfect Colorful so pretty Lake Travis may not be the most beautiful lake in the world but it s still something to see I think the Oasis truly the beauty of its surroundings like the and around it I m a sucker for stuff like this which you don t encounter every day just saying Although my and I rushed to get here we were about away from work for lunch I felt relaxed and at peace sorry for the tangent but I also have to say that the service was really accommodating We had to eat FAST so the waitress made sure to get the food out and hand us our check right then and there I had to eat Although I t take my time to enjoy the shrimp I remember liking them The shrimp was well and everything else was good too free chips and but pretty spicy Food is dining experience if I were in again I would come here again No shameI wish I could give separate for separate of the restaurant The view out of It is so amazing So so beautiful The service out of They re friendly but due to it always being service is beyond slow Food out of Nothing good nothing bad Really everyone who goes there that we re all just paying for the viewThe food here is its basic food not fancy full of flavor the view is definitely worth the food Service always been great as well I will always come to The OasisThis place is beautiful but food is not the best option for this placeMiddle of nowhere hard drive back at night to venue great fun place Family friendlyThe Oasis really been improving since my last review The quality of both the food and the service substantially and now there is water in the lake again too They still have room to improve especially on the service end but once again the Oasis is an enjoyable place to eat as long as you don t have a schedule to keepThe Oasis in my opinion t the place to go for dinner It IS however the place to go to watch a beautiful sunset and enjoy a couple of withReally good The location is incredible The of the Lake are Food was excellent but they did not have certain You serve yourself and they are very busyMy husband and I where visiting the area from out of town We saw this restaurant and added it to our list of to do One we got to we spoke to many different people around here and every single one of them told us not to bother going here because the food is not good We decided to see for ourselves and were pleasantly This place was totally worth the visit The were amazing and a reason alone to visit The food was fine No it was not a gourmet steak house but that is not that they are themselves to be It was comparable to probably even a little better but none the less it was no where near what we were based on what we were hearing They had two live We only one which was very good of people of all where dancing and a great time So basically the atmosphere were amazing the food was good and the live music was a blast We highly recommend this place to anyone who not been before It is absolutely worth the visitThe Oasis the most beautiful view of any place I ever been We originally with people but then more were joining us and the people at The Oasis worked quickly to accommodate us with a bigger table The chips and were good The had a great kick We ordered for Not too spicy but delicious nonetheless I ordered Shiner Bock pork So good They were with rice and I was stuffed was a bit much for me but well worth the money We had plenty of different people helping us One girl took our order then a bunch of people run our I this restaurant The view and were astounding were slightly high but that s to be for such a great viewFabulous view especially since the lake is back to only low The food is average but the experience a The service was above average and our waitress was very attentive even though she was covering a large area Sadly they had no tap so had to settle for Will go back againWent here on my anniversary because of the great view of course And like most everyone else I already knew the food and service might be an issue but sometimes a place a do it just right Our server forgot his name made everything the way we he us move tables got and food in a timely manner and really made the night memorable So the service could be hit or miss but not always The food is had the surf and turf not too bad shrimp and beef could be a better but still ate all the shrimp and beef Anyway the view and the are perfect date or special occasion place but don t expect fancy food and if you know how to be a customer most likely the staff will treat you accordinglyAwesome place Love the remodel they did Still the place to catch a margarita dinner and a hell of a sunsetto go Here THE VIEW for sure It is in an awesome location I love the way this place is set up with some really neat seating that would be on your own private patio at home instead of the same seating you see everywhere get one thing straight You do not come here the best food If you do then you will be highly disappointed Chips and are and they are pretty good so you can come and have while you chill out and watch the view We got but they were not great but not horrible Just This place my vote for the view chips and the view are what I would come for againOne of my favorite to eat in the hill country Good food Perfect ambience and of Lake TravisNot only is the food decent here but that sunset Wow oh wow If you haven t seen the sunset over Lake Travis well this is the perfect spot Grab some good food and to top it off too Not a bad choice in the house here The sunset everything worth itThis place is amazing Well just the because the food is disgusting and the areI haven t tried the food here but I came here to check out the sunset one time The place is huge I mean REALLY huge Restaurant is three high You can find a brewery gift shop near the restaurant as well Live music is at the very top floor The place is known for its sunset view so if you come during sunset time it is going to be really with people But the view was gorgeous I literally stood there in awe as I see the sun going down Overall I highly recommend this place If you are ever in the Oasis is definitely a mustAmazing place for a couple to watch the sunset The were beer cold The deck was just a great place to sit and unwindI love the Oasis because of the view and all of the various to eat throughout the restaurant The menu is really bad There t much to choose from and what they do have is and not really that good taste wise The margarita s are always weak or watered down because they are made You will have to ask them to add an extra shot if you want to make it worth while What I wrote like a lot of but I always come to this place and really love it because the view atmosphere and aura is unbeatableThis place the BEST view in what like a mission pretty cool atmosphere I would go back just for that That s definitely the draw as well as the live music On a long weekend to we stopped in for dinner and a concert perfect night at sunset with plenty of seating and to keep it comfortable in the summer sun I had the chicken which were my husband ordered a which was DELICIOUS we are still talking about it My was a little on the sweet side and the was good Service was friendly a little slow but he had a lot of tables we t in a rush and it like a hike for them to get anything because the place is HUGE They don t take and now I see why plenty of tables again with the best in Definitely a must go if visiting just don t expect the food to be amazing Perfect place to sip on a drink enjoy the music and and justI was bad customer service after seeing all the here but the were pretty nice and friendly The only thing I t like about this place was food I ordered chicken and it was so bad The corn and chicken tasted so cheap and the cheese on the top was tasteless me of cold that I had at Cabana a few ago But I think it was worth going after all since I could enjoy beautiful sunset from my tableLook here s what you come to the Oasis for View Beer Chips If that s what you come for you have a star time Then head out to a real joint to dine See it s not that hardI was an awesome view and bad food but boy was I wrong Excellent shrimp and really great serviceThis place an awesome view The food is so if thats what you like then you won t be disappointed The service could have been better The waiter and short with our but overall this place is a good stopAMAZING Got chips and a couple of frozen and we were good to go Lots of fun to look at I love that take the time to show their uniqueness As a tourist this is a four for meI thought oasis was a great destination I am at all the negative but I came with no and have no about the place It is basically a giant bar so one should expect an delight Come here for the awesome and of with a great view of the lake We t there for the sunset but the sun allegedly goes down every night and there is a great view of it from here We had some which was fresh and tasty plus some fancy When in the area I will go back and try dinnerI was nervous when I saw the full parking lot for the Oasis but we were immediately seated on a afternoon The place is huge enormous even seating about a thousand on their several and We were on the third level and one table away from the edge Lake Travis must have been here before his infamous incident on the lake as the server was all about pushing the booze on us Soda what How about a drink Maybe he could use that in court I got a pina which was tasty but not breaking new ground Then I had the Grouper Salad which was good The rest of the bunch had salmon or tuna can t recall We all agreed the view was worth coming back the food was average and the service was mechanical but efficient Good for all old whoeverNow I am this as a new and as a first timer Please take that into consideration as I see how bad some of the are I was told before we went that the food t that great so I went with low of that That said I the atmosphere The view at sunset is spectacular and the feel of the place is so fun Knowing ahead of time to not expect great food I had a few chips and then a couple of a and a both were excellent I will bring all of our out of town there just to enjoy the view and to spend time together I the little and what felt like a unique to experience I know how much is a town so many will not go just because of that issue alone I will continue to go just to have a cool place to chillI am happy to report a great experience my chicken lettuce wrap messy but they brought me Gorgeous sunsetWe had our departmental retreat at The Oasis yesterday This was the first time I d been there since the fire and It was a rainy day and the lake is still pretty low but I think it was still a very pleasant experience We drank more coffee than and they a nice buffet lunch with chicken and beef and all the normal and I think it was good The staff that took care of us was very efficient and professional We brought our own projector and screen for and they provided the microphone and sound system Frankly I would have never that they were set up for like this but I think everyone in our group of or so the day We were gone before sunset but it was cloudy so we t miss anything thereThis place low despite being always I been coming here for twenty You don t go for the best meal you ever had you go for the view and experience Chips and are actually above average is fresh and got some balanced heat and flavor I ordered here and the All good tuna salad was pretty good too This is an area institution and it turned into a whole development that is pretty impressive Check out the candy shop on the second floor of the development while you wait or afterWe went here to have dinner watch the Amazing The waiter got us a table right by the edge He was very attentive helpful quite funny Chip Chile con was good I think we finished of that Then we got the beef which was wonderful the grilled shrimp was good too No from us and for dessert I think we got the chocolate cheesecake or something like that We finished everything while watching together It felt like no one else is around it was just him I Amazing experience we definitely would be back for more we wrote our on the wall by the barGorgeous whether it be a sunny or cloudy day Food is t care for the salad but the was delicious for a small menu change Anyone coming should prepare for lots of picture takingSo I had read so many disappointing concerning the FOOD of this place We to check out the view and play it safe on what to order We went with a simple dish that is fool proof We ordered the portion for two with plenty of food for our party of three We ordered a beer each Final cost was around w tip I had better They were pretty bland for my taste Our waiter was awesome and kept us happy with flour The view is incredible My tip eat the plate on the menu get a cold beer and enjoy the beautiful sunsetI don t go there for the eating I don t go there for the I don t go there for the and the parking sometimes I don t go there for the though it s certainly some view I m with Anna M on this I go dance and hear The Brew They can get the party moving they can get the dance floor they can get your stiff swinging work you up into a sweat Everybody s moving sexy everybody s fun con la Going Count me inJust returned from a day vacation in from yes I know ANOTHER in I read the on the Oasis prior to our trip and that the food was and visiting the place was more for the experience of it all and not the food To my surprise I was enamored with the Oasis All of it too The drive up to the place is beautiful The building is beautiful The setting of the place is beautiful There is currently a lot of construction happening on site right now but that t too much of an issue Food wise this place is fantastic The chips and were a little generic but still tasty We ordered the cheese dip and it was great For my main meal I got the crawfish oh man so good Highly recommend them On top of this the service was great and the view lived up to the for sure Based on my experience I highly recommend coming for lunch on a sunny day The sun really up all the natural beauty of Lake Travis and the surrounding area It is quite spectacular I am definitely coming backI feel bad that the Oasis such a bad review so I figured I would give it a goon one the view is amazing and it was an awesome place to visit since we do not have huge like this in new the food was very yummyThe view is phenomenal are strong just how I like them Only had a few Chips were delicious Chicken s were amazing I would definitely come back here when I am in town As for the service it t the best We had no where to go so we re in no rush but it is pretty busyAmazing Decent beer selection Long wait almost every night for dinner though It s a spectacle you want to see but don t expect to be blown away by their foodI be honest this review is based on a wedding reception at the oasis over the weekend If I rated the restaurant alone it t be more than because you go to the oasis for the Scenery and definitely not the food and service Anyway Back to the wedding The reception was on the third floor of the oasis and was amazing The staff was beyond attentive and I that they knew what each guest was going to have ahead of time so that they t off The also received their about two after they say down which was a nice touch The were beyond personable and friendly big props to them The meal I had salmon with a and was the best meal I had at the oasis by a long shot Of course the highlight of the night was being able to enjoy the lake with a cocktail along with good However there were of this venue but none were big enough to reduce it below The reception area was not blocked off at first and we had some who to take Interesting odd and creepy all at once the outside is very loud with bad karaoke sounding on a but this is the oasis and it was that it would be loud there were some missing from the electrical Yes this is picky but it was also a bit of a safety hazard for my with Overall best wedding venue I been to thus farI am writing this review BEFORE I read any of the as it like it may be rated a bit lower First off crazy gorgeous view of Lake Travis But this review will be of the food and service because exceptional are easy to mix Our server on was Tyrone and he gave us good service The specialty margarita I had was the Gold Margarita and was quite yummy so I had two They were that good Now onto the food I had the fish They were fish on corn tortilla with a yummy sauce and pico de There was a smear of on the side Should have been more than a little smear on a bed of lettuce I know that are expensive but at least give a tablespoon of The best part of my meal is that the fish was and still moist but completely through and not fishy The rice and on the side were very tasty as well My wife had the surf and turf which were decent according to her as the shrimp were very good but the meat a tad tough All in all a solidHad a nice meal with The view was really what it Good place to spend the evening over lunch Bring back brunchAs usual food was but the main course is always the wonderful Totally worth the driveI about the wonderful from the Oasis and I was not disappointed I also hear about the food being at best so my and I to find the best on the menu to share We both got mine was the Tropical Depression which for was wonderful I t taste the alcohol but definitely felt it We the which was delicious and actually pretty filling For an entree we the Chicken Enchilada Stack The tasted a little odd they were supposed to have bacon but we t taste that The enchilada stack had a delicious sauce but we t taste the Hatch Chile at all Overall I d give the food three View five The service was so so but our waitress quite obviously had a lot of big tops along with our table so it t her fault plus we just the view and t in a rushBest service of any restaurant I tried in the greater area Delicious of the lake alone worth a visitThis place is always but I love taking my and family who visit me from out of town They enjoy it and I m always by its view Staff is always friendly and their is good Keep it up OasisThe of Lake Travis are amazing from the Oasis The food is usually pretty good too but we go for the fun atmosphere andglad we went most say its over priced and touristy so i guess i the worst Got there around on a and was seated right away as we were leaving around though there was a long line Food and t seem at all maybe plate and were close to Beer was I thought the food was good just standard were decent The lake was down due to the drought but its still an amazing view I guess its new construction outside the restaurant with other and however of the retail were emptyIncredible view It s hot but they got a ton of and that mist you The food is not incredible but definitely above average Great if you want to throw back some on a afternoon and soak up the sun beautiful Lake TravisThe view is what everyone goes here for and it was definitely a beautiful view Service on who you get I think our first server took a while to ask us what we to drink but it was hot at our table since there t a fan so they let us move Our new waitress was better The food is kind of but what I got was pretty good and worth it in my opinion I got the fish and it was delectable You get a pretty big size fish with each soft and lime to squeeze on top Definitely a good entree We also got a dessert dish that was good as wellThe view is gorgeous The water was nice and cool There were and plenty of to take However the food was mediocre It is of a and it could have been better We ordered the mixed for with beef chicken and shrimp The shrimp were small like shrimp cocktail shrimp That was very displeasing that was my only complaint about the restaurant Service was good and you get to keep your water cupWe been here several times and it never been consistent The first time in it was fantastic The food was great our view wonderful the server friendly and informative The next time we went it was a disaster waiting so long we had finished a bottle of wine and then the food like it had been ready to be to us for all that time we cold and just like it had been forgotten so we t want to wait to get it warmed up so ordered more wine and got out Stopped going Then we the was new management or owner change so went back again the are nice and is open and comfortable We had out of town family and they it a lot and we were nervous which way it would go so were relieved the food was good and friendly waiter a little nervous by hovering manager but perhaps they were all just trying to bring back the quality so we d go there again Whenever we go we feel its a toss of the dice but the place is nice and can be very good if you just speak up and say little like How long would this take to make Just to not be a jerk but let them know you don t have all night Order definitely and let the waiter know when they re doneThe are incredible at this restaurant The are always perfect The food is pretty good as well but it s not so fancy They serve in plastic a lot of the time All in all it s a fun place to out and go with of people I recommend the they are so good These are unedited of the sunset from the outdoor seatingGreat food Be prepared for a wait of up to if you have a big party we had No only call ahead Had a great time Just a very long waitThe food is pedestrian The service is spotty The are average and the are made with cheap tequila The never seem to change The are too high And I STILL give it The the Lake Travis the brand new lower deck the view out into the hill country there s just nothing like this place It s more thanWhat can be better than a nice dinner a lake A dinner a lake with a beautiful sunset This venue is huge to support lots of but their nightly event of serving up a spectacular sunset with dinner is definitely an attraction The staff making the view memorable down to a science Sunset time is posted on their daily and about before all are removed so a clear view is available for all So a for atmosphere The food is a mix of and Chips and start the dining experience The chips were light and crisp I the chicken pecan salad large tasty and filling My husband had the spicy chicken sandwich which he So a for the food The service Being so close to sunset the get busy moving and such so there are long of time when no one is available to provide water and such Our waiter some on the table and I had to politely ask home if it could be up So I d give the service a With an average of I d say the overall experience was a winner If you are in head to The Oasis for enjoyable outdoor dining and a spectacular view of the sunsetDon t be by all the So here is the Like many I have been meaning to head to the Oasis but t quite convince myself to head there because of all the terrible But it was a beautiful and I just to cross this place off my list When we got there I was immediately blown away What a cute little getaway We put our down and during the minute wait went upstairs and picked up some AMAZING hot sauce and jerky We were seated right around sunset at an amazing table Bring warm clothes because the space don t do much The chips and were fresh and delicious I would give this alone The waiter was attentive and prompt I had the Tuna Salad which was pretty like Bread quality food and the had the pork which he The were also nice but next time I may skip the All in all the food was a bit for what it was but the view was totally worth it I definitely recommend going but perhaps go to have chips and a drink watch the sunset and head elsewhere for dinnerIf you re looking for great food this is not the place for you People go to The Oasis for the VIEW the atmosphere and Their food is not great but it s not horrible Food it s over priced but I think is due to the location I enjoy going because of the view and the I always order their because they are decent So if you go hungry and looking for good you will probably be disappointed but if you looking for a nice place to relax have and enjoy the sunset this is the place to go The downside is that the waiting time to get a table during dinner time is and during the weekend is even I m talking about waiting so don t go around that time if you are hungry or maybe eat something small before you head out During lunch time is not bad at all you get a table within But the view is definitely better during dinner time because of the Anyhow I truly every time I been there and I continue going every time I be in oh I almost forgot to mention that they have a gift shop and they have all kind of coolGreat service Beautiful view were delicious Sweet potato are spicy and sweet It s a must see on Lake TravisAs many people point out you come here for the view and anything else is secondary to that said that we really our lunch there last weekend We came around and there was no wait the place is so big I doubt it await except for at Sunset I can imagine it s a zoo around that time and I hate that don t take The house chips are delicious we t stop eating them and they re some of the best around The a good kick to it on the side I had a house special With that title I was big but it was probably the biggest disappointment of the meal I should have stuck with beer or a margarita I had the shrimp which were too expensive but delicious Again they had a nice bit of heat from the sauce The rice they came with was also fantastic and the salad was good too My had the and the kitchen up the order but then sent out the right order on the house so we ended up with a table full of chicken steak and shrimp Again all very good but over priced I will come back when we have other out of with us but their mean this will never be a regular hangout spot unfortunatelyAgreed with other Go for the and take in the beautiful view What a beautiful establishment Can t wait to come back in the summer timeThe facility is awesome Great Location with many looking over Lake Travis Very very friendly service My wife and daughter had a great lunch their and we will returnMy wife and two went to the Oasis that the would be wrong We had read about poor service long and so so food all usually offset by the incredible view Well long story short the food was pretty darn good We had the red fish a grilled chicken sandwich and tortilla soup All were what we Our server and his trainee were very attentive and there was little that could be classified as poor service We had originally been seated outside by the lovely Gabby at our request but given the degree we found it to be just too hot and our original server if we could move inside Unfortunately we t keep the same server but was able to find us a nice seat inside with a great view as well Overall the Oasis was a pretty good restaurant We our meal and while it might be priced a little higher than the overall package was worth itA very memorable experience The sunset was absolutely stunning the food was the service was nice Can t ask for much moreFirst time here and the are phenomenal Food and service not so much We stuck to the that were A I tried the and Chicken Chips and were pretty good I drank the Perfect that was pretty tasty I tried it blended and on the Lots to do near the restaurant They have a few you can shop at for knick or If I lived in I think I would be here every week I am a sucker for a good viewWe had a huge group that reserved the venue for an evening We were beer and wine There was a and chip bar which was de lish The buffet dinner was and taste The view was beautiful and watching the sunset was breath taking Also they had a band and provided a dance floor which made for great entertainingOverall good experience The food t all that but the atmosphere is great and service was good The are amazing and are strongFood view are great but even when it s not busy it s just service Definitely difficult to get on or extraWait time was short on a can t get much better than that were a little but worth the cost for the experience We had a party of six and good was brought out at different times some of our party was waiting more than after we got our for theirs to come out But the view was a good distraction Definitely a spot to take out ofGreat over lake Travis We went to the restaurant and there was plenty of seating on the balcony The potato were super crispy and flavorful Great place to grab a drink and catch up with oldGreat spot to just grab a beer and enjoy the view The food is not worth waiting an hour and a halfMy review is only on the location and building Cool restaurant and the view is nice with lots of fun photo for me The word on the streets is this place is a well known tourist trap It s a shame I the food is no and from the my Yelp concurThe sweetheart dinner for Valentine s Day it s not worth it It s an dinner The restaurant it s awesome pretty decent food amazing view We had service and had our lock of love set on their balcony It s an amazing experience that you should try if you are in the areaEverything was good not my style of for food but service was great The view is amazing and very nice to enjoy a nice mealWe stopped in for on a beautiful day during the week That s the time to go to avoid long and a LOUD experience Service was great They even us one of our that took an unusually long time to show up No big deal to us at all but they on it so Many rake the quality of food at the Oasis I have always had good quality when I gone there although I not been often This time we just had and and they were all great chips and a few other All really really good It s an interesting place to go Very different from how it was ago fire with all the other and even connected to it And it may be cliche but the view is awesome Lake Travis sure is beautiful when there is water in itWe went to The Oasis primarily for the which are great and honestly the food was better than I My were good while I had much better elsewhere I still these My wife ordered one of their which she thought was good To be clear The Oasis is not a gourmet restaurant it is a touristy spot with great of Lake Travis and the surrounding area For what it is though it more than met myToday was supposed to be a day that my wife and I cruise winding twisting and hilly roadway of Highway Well we had to make decision of left or right once we at Highway We chose right and obviously we chose the right decision because we ended up driving by The Oasis My wife myself and my really enjoy the of the Oasis We love sitting outside and Lake Travis Our host was who immediately to our needs upon being seated During lunch this place is not jam and there is plenty of parking provided you get here before the rush There were no long like there are during the evening times The are adequate and the food is a little but overall it is a nice experience At the end of the day it may seem as if you are paying more for the view than the quality of food We experienced slight disappointment with our food we were not to make to the Shrimp and the mixed were not on accommodating us but we declined Her willingness to get me more was enough for me We still the overall experience of Oasis and would definitely be when were out in during date night day I sent out the I took of the lake and my wife to my family and Now they want me to take them here as well like a group adventure which I absolutely loveIncredible view Average food The chicken pecan salad was yummy because their strawberry lemon vinegarette was delicious but the chicken and fruit were average Great touristy place to take good of Lake Travis thoughIt s hard to rate this place in because it really on what you are going here for If you want good food this is not the place for you If you want a good bar and a really beautiful setting it is the place to be So don t go for the food and you won t be disappointed For those that don t know they host work and for a reasonable price and the food is DELICIOUS It s the restaurant thatThe OASIS is a nice bar and restaurant t come back for their food but their are incredible Their are pretty good too but food is not a This is a good spot for a date or a familyYou should take this review with a grain of salt because I m an absolute SUCKER for atmosphere The food could have been but honestly with that kind of view I would enjoy the of swill I m new to so I knew nothing about how timing is everything at this place in of the wait the weather It was by luck that we got a table in five and right at the front of the deck facing a glorious sunset Go and just order something simple like and chips and Lucky for them the food is not the pointAfter hearing chatter about how The Oasis is really about the View and perhaps and not about the food or service I was still interested in the Oasis for myself My final conclusion is that the chatter is basically correct While the food t great it t bad either and our waitress was actually very good I a small place but the Oasis is actually pretty big with lots of tables and room The view is amazing and it to be away in the I like that the Oasis kind of you away to another place It t feel like or and a upscale to it I m sure this is the kind of place where each visit is slightly different whether its the service or food or but overall it s a beautiful spot with of potential and I can definitely see this as one of my new chillIn a nutshell You re paying for the view and the food It was the two of us We went there around during the week so it t busy yet the girl was skeptical about giving us a lake view table even though we for it twice We drove all the way from so we the best experience we can get Our server was very nice but the who us the food never informed our server of our other like Which is why I m giving it four I just wish the were trained better Yet I highly recommend you visit this place It s worth itSeeing the negative I almost decided to skip it This past weekend we drove to to drop off my daughter at UT as spring semester is about to start Decided to stop by on a Not too many people so we were seated quickly inside near the window Plenty of outside but it was a bit cold and windy on this day We had a wonderful waitress and our water and chips were several times without us for it Food as was little more but given the location and view this was well worth it I highly recommend anyone to try it again or first time if they re in the areafor the Amazing view The grounds are gorgeous you check in at the desk you give your cell phone number to the host and once your table is ready you get a text that your table is ready to go you get to check back in otherwise you lose your table to the next guest so be advised of this method Service was not good our waiter would disappear I was at other near me they were very attentive to the needs our waiter unfortunately was nonexistent Our food t too bad but then again I only ordered so not too difficult I also ordered a margarita which was good I probably would come back just to bring out of state and family If this establishment would hire good management and properly trained staff this place would ROCK Get an excellent marketing person tooI am a fan of The Oasis concept I wish I could give star for various of it I do not like or are just in my book All in all I do love The Oasis The atmosphere is great you can t beat the view in addition to the awesome sunset This place is a MUST to take out of town to Ever since they did the massive restoration renovation the place did get much bigger I love what they did with the place it gorgeous I LOVE to go to The Oasis on nights during the Spring Summer for the music I me some The Brew Now for the down sides The parking can be horrible on the especially on holiday But they do have golf cart that can take you to from the restaurant if you have the extra dough valet parking The menu drink are really high for what you get the taste portion is very sub par The only I people go there me is because of the the view I t say people go there for the or foodI guess if you come here you come for the view It is not the most amazing drink or food The place is massive and there is so much going on Between the gift shop brewery restaurant there is just so much to see and explore The view on a sunny afternoon is just beautiful but other than that food is not utterly eXceptional I will just give it that many because of its amazing view Our beer was good sunset lager tasted goodOne thing you re not going to the oasis for the food Now not to the say the food is bad it s actually pretty good specially for the price but it s nothing g to rave about Now the view and overall atmosphere is if it t for the fact that it is on the lake the first thing you d say would be what theme are they even going for but as soon as you see the view and porch you remember why you went in the first place Yes it s a bit far from most but for a special occasion a first time try or if you have the time it s worth the trip Hit for a time during the week you won t regret itAwesome view Good food A bit of a wait Chicken pecan salad was yummy No beer on draft made me sad Hubby got chicken He said they were very goodThe food is not all that are awesome especially if you have this amazing view Had a relax chill time watching the sunset What this s Oasis place GREAT is the view thats what you basically pay for but hey its worth it Thats why i give itThe food was pretty alright slightly The view is amazing and our server was very friendly with usThis place is amazing to go on a nice day and enjoy the view decent food huge selection a great place to take the familyThis is definitely worthy of a stop if you re living in or just passing through It s iconic and some of the most picturesque of Lake Travis unless you own a magnificent mansion along the lake Many are still Open except a few on the balcony g the lake Definitely wear your mask It s Valet This is actually very reasonable and you time from the parking lot as well as dust Trolley golf cart service available too if on a tight budget and wait to save it for that frozen margarita Grab the Sunset Get a frozen drink and enjoy the sunset Food Food was great and they do have bottomless chips which are but lack flavor could use some more kick are good Beau s salad and fish are very good Try the cheesecakeThis place is worth going to entirely for the view I think everyone in the restaurant got up at some point to take a picture as the sun was setting It was beautiful The food was alright They ended up never bring us our appetizer but were really busy so it I m not that mad about it The hurricane were pretty good There s a limit of two I definitely t have even drank more than one And you get to keep the glass It was cute and lantern y at night definitely more about the ambience than the food thoughDefinitely a limited menu during Covid View is killer are good and decently strong Got to keep the glass too which was a nice touch Split the they were good and portion was plenty View is what the place special and the Definitely worth going to at least onceThis place for higher quality menu It could be much more Very beautiful thoughWe love the and atmosphere of the Oasis The are great Overall the food is average but the service up for itIt s not bad if you go at the right time If you go during the busy time you can expect less than perfect The place is not known for the food but for the also order the safe bet such as a it is delicious are big too Wish the of wine we re more generous but for the price it s I m a local and I enjoy going during non peakThe Oasis is a great place to grab some food a drink or two and take in the of Lake Travis The food itself is I had the special of the day It was chicken with rice and It t anything special The are tasty and will sneak up on you if you are not thinking about it You go there for the amazing If you haven t been there before you will not be disappointed Right now is the best time to go because it s not because of our current situation The food would make it a three out of five in my opinion The spectacular made me bump it up to a four out of five Once you go there you will never forget about it I will go to The Oasis every year for sureWe read some pretty horrific re this place regarding the the slow service and horrible food But alas my niece to meet here for lunch Our experience was this as a first time diner here The were pleasant and very friendly Albeit they were no terribly busy but we were seated immediately So the baloney about rude or non and were the exact opposite in our experience Our server was very friendly The service was a tad slow but acceptable I the of many and had the beef and chicken It was hot and freshly and quite good We also ordered a Hurricane drink and got a souvenir glass Finally the were spectacular on a beautiful winter day Lake TravisThe view was spectacular The food was good beef were plenty The were very tender with a good rub The best were the and the man n cheese Great service It isThis place was by a friend who in You go there for the view like you re dining by the Mediterranean Sea The food is there are other that have way better food We had fun though just to experience itI decided to come to this restaurant to see a beautiful sunset I before the sunset but they were very nice and told me to take a seat and stay as long as I want I ordered Pork Chile which was very tasty For drink I had Tropical Depression that was fruity and good as well They seated me on the deck the sunset was beautiful I a nice afternoon with a good meal drink and a beautiful sunset Tropical Depression Pork ChileVisiting our daughter and family in we decided to have dinner at the famous Oasis restaurant on Lake Travis This is one of the most beautiful in the world It on the side of a mountain over looking gorgeous Lake Travis high up The view is tremendous especially at sunset The food is in the style and is casual but very good Not the best but very good The place was really really crowded We an hour for a table for It was also quite noisy and quite hectic There is indoor as well as outdoor seating I d say the place probably somewhere between and people at a time spread across many Service was hectic as well The deal here is the view You just cannot beat the view The place is built like a eight or story castle hanging off the side of a mountain with fabulous eclectic spread everywhere throughout the facility Music is constantly and the place is really This is a great people watching place They have a huge story parking garage adjacent The are a little high but fair As I said is a bit hectic The are clean and plentiful They have several music and like there s no tomorrow It is obviously the go to place in Don t miss itWe came in being told there would be a to hour long wait and ended up only waiting We came at so this was a pleasant surprise I have to say service was pretty slow at first but got better through the dinner My was very tasty but the were supposedly not as good So average food I would say But i don t think people come here for the food the view is amazing The sunset was absolutely beautiful and honestly the reason for the Also for it being such a hot night they kept us at a good temperature water Overall don t expect too much from the food but the view is worth itThe view was absolutely beautiful The food was just not what I menu needs to be My y o barely touched his food His chicken were fried hard and potato too spicy We just regular The were outstanding and the best thing on the limited menu I to take because we were so hot and hungry when we got there All I could think about was cooling offThe view is absolutely beautiful This is a one of a kind restaurant with beautiful and an eccentric owner The only side is that the food really t that amazing and is for what it is But you have to see it at least once as it is truly uniqueWe the Oasis restaurant and had a great time with No about the food and other than the menu being fairly over priced This restaurant is similar to other but one key difference is the and view of the lakeFood was but the view was to die for the lake and the sunset make the place a really nice stop to to enjoy the day fallWow The Oasis some pretty terrible I do believe it all comes down to your wait time where you are seated and the server you get We were sat at a very awkward table for our party and we did not have a good view at all We to move and they us to a table with an AMAZING view of Lake Travis Ask and you shall receive The food is not life If you go to The Oasis knowing that you will be pleasantly We our food If you are looking for over the top delicious food head to Congress Ave Oasis is for the unique view Our server was great As the sun she our and even brought out several more to make sure we were covered She was attentive to our drink and food needs and spaced everything out very well So we went on Memorial Day weekend on around We did not have to wait party of service was great food was and the view is memorable to say the least I think everyone should check it out at least onceWe had a really good experience here today The view was spectacular as always but especially since the lake is near full now We right when they at so we got a great table with a great view outside The service was reasonably fast and our and in an appropriate time This t always the case here especially when it busy but today was great We had the chicken and chicken fire The fire are chicken with ranch and they were good The were very good They are chicken breast with wrapped in smoked bacon grilled and then with a tangy sauce Very tasty I had the spicy chicken sandwich which was a grilled chicken breast with chili spice and topped with bacon pepper jack and lettuce pickle and tomato on a pretzel bun It comes with ranch I should have for their to put on it That would put this sandwich over the top Overall a very nice experience which was refreshing after some previous We will come back for the view and the and try some other tooThe view was beautiful We sat on the patio and some They were pretty generic and chicken was a little dry but everything else was great Our waitress was AWESOME Super attentive and quick Will come back for the amazing view andI am a sucker for unique which for me include beautiful This review was highly based on that preference Oasis is on a hilltop Lake Travis It beyond amazing day or night The air is typically a lot cleaner due to the elevation and while you might be hard to spot the from the city drive yourself here to be of their beauty On top of the alongside oasis you will find a cute quaint little plaza that is only expanding The immediate courtyard where oasis is you will find adorable and Oasis itself a bar area as well as indoor and outdoor seating No matter the wait DEFINITELY request to be seated outside unless its of course The view is simply The air is really nice and crisp in this serenity The menu itself style food They recently got rid of their but otherwise you find a mix of surf and turf The are not too many and the food is nothing to be about the service is just depending on how busy they are I never had exceptional service though My favorite is probably their shrimp though the rice and are just super bland The view is what on me back Definitely making this place a must see inPretty much like the view and the the were pretty good And I the live band and the people too as well because they got up to dance Got really around likeThe food is nothing fancy but the view is absolutely unbelievable If you re traveling to and enjoy the outdoors lake then you have to check out The Oasis We got beef to share and had more than enough food The corn tasted fresh and the meat was incredibly tender and well seasoned For a fun dinner The Oasis is a winnerEveryone comes here for the spectacular view of Lake Travis If you re fortunate enough to get a table with an unobstructed view you re in for a great experience The food is good the are perfect and everything about the restaurant is fun and very pretty Our waiter was and he was the best A table of five can be a nightmare for We were there to chill out for a few waiting to see the sunset and he was very friendly and attentive He made our evening even better You will be missing out if you don t enjoy a meal at The OasisAmazing Fun atmosphere The food definitely Chips and are great The pecan chicken salad was also very good Still a little but obviously you re paying for location And the view is worth a little extraThis was my first time there I got the chicken The were very big you could share with someone else We went around and it was before the dinner rush We had a very good view of the water Our waitress was very nice and attentive It is up in price and I wish they had more variety on their menuWent here for a drink and the view Had to reserve and wait just to get a table on the balcony in order to have a few and by the time we got that table we figured what the heck threw caution to the wind and despite all the abysmal ordered some lunch Thing is the food t half bad Yes the is really meek and it a plate of chopped extra charge to spice it up but then it was pretty good and the chips were fine I got the beef and my wife got a salmon plate and although not exceptional it was perfectly fine and worth the view Only a small selection of draft but goodI think if you re coming to the Oasis you re doing it for the and not the food I would hope that people understand this t a starred restaurant but rather a family friendly tourist spot Keeping that in mind it was a perfectly pleasant experience I t expect it to be so large but the place is HUGE Only some of the dining were open on a evening but it was still very busy The food was average but not For and our bill came out to just around and that included The service was very friendly The at sunset really are wonderful Looking over the lake you might even be able to relax while the of other people around youNo one s The Oasis Seriously The original Oasis burned half down a couple of ago but the intrepid crew sprung into action and rebuilt it quickly and t go overboard it a good thing Great of Lake Travis edgy but not too edgy Pretty good food and awesome A big stage with music and dancing tooBeautiful and great for an appetizer and a few The food and service is or at best It s definitely a place you go for theBeautiful place We were married here a couple of ago in one of the special event and it was very affordable for all that was and for how beautiful it was The whole area around the restaurant is very beautiful and picturesque with excellent of the on Lake Travis and is in the perfect place to see the sunset on the lake Many people thought we had a destination wedding based off our We come every so often and walk around the or go up to the Oasis Brewery In the Brewery we had the beef and the Beyond Meat Both were excellent I have never had a as flavorful as the beef It big all around and outdoor that give a overlookEvery time I go to I make sure I come here to watch the sunset The menu since the last time I been here overall the customer service is good and very nice place to watch the sunsetView is amazing Great place to bring The only issue was that there were constantly a lot of on our food and Not sure how it can be but its not appealing to have literally you are constantly trying to get rid ofReview based on atmosphere and This is a must do if you re visiting the area Come for the sunset sit outside and have some get at least one drink in a commemorative glass The were good and strong I can t speak for the food since I read in advance to avoid the food but the complimentary chips and were enjoyable Service was good as well Definitely come here one night if you find yourself in the areaThe most and if you re there for the sunset you will get some beautiful video or It almost fake The hostess bartender waiter were all very pleasant The waiter was a bit slow but in his defense it was the end of the night and it was humid I saw a few that you should only come here for the and not the food but I would like to say that the dish I order plate was delicious I would actually want to go back and try some of their other while I get to enjoy that amazing scenery Now beware the wait time can get intense I was there on a evening and we to be seated While we we went to the bar and ordered some which were delicious but the alcohol content was low Considering the two large I had I should have felt some kind of feel good moment and t Some they serve they come in these nice glasses that you get to take home which I thought was a nice gesture If I get to go back I would go during the week so hopefully it s not as many peopleMy and I had a nice lunch here We sat outside and took in the beautiful lakeGreat view on the lake Amazing location with sunset All other were closed was More would have been nice Server gave us time to talk The heat a lot after the sun went down were tasty We d go backI just want to thank everyone that posted bad The OASIS was phenomenal from the to the manager to our waiter Sam and the food Your bad made them step up their game The were good I had a hurricane gave me a good buzz So we had over an hour wait we sat at the bar to have a drink while we were waiting for our table we to order an appetizer while we in the bar area but were told they t serve food They don t even offer chips and How do you serve alcohol and not have a bar menu At least serve chips and Anyway I to see a manager passing by who I the question to and made the chips and suggestion He was so kind he said there was an area that we could order and if we were waiting for a table inside or outside I told him outside He said he would be right back We thought he was going to see if there was a table available in the area where we could order while we in our table but he came back and immediately seated us at a table with a great view of the water and sunset Our waiter Sam was AMAZING and everything came out to perfection The and chicken were delicious Our salmon chicken dish de poll and fish were all very delicious and the and rice were We even got a complimentary birthday brownie for my sister s birthday We definitely be back when we come back toBeautiful view food so keep it simple like good and service Been coming overI know there are several bad on this place I tried it today with my family and everyone what they ordered and the experience It s not five star dining but so that should set the bar The beef for two was absolutely awesome The steak was tender and to perfection The sides were all fresh Other high were the shrimp and the fish No one in our party had a bad meal but in fact about it The staff was friendly but I will say the who brought the food to our table t leave a great impression Our food was practically thrown in front of us We will be back soon and hope the serving experience isGreat place great except for young up front that take to most unfavorable tables Insist on a nice table and you will have a great timeI came here with a good friend on Father s Day We knew there was going to be a wait because of the holiday We were told about To our surprise it ended up being only We had no problem parking in the lot and were even a ride up to the restaurant by the golf cart service that goes around the parking lot We only came here to enjoy some and the view The chips were very good and the was fresh and delicious My friend had the margarita which she I had the Oasis Sunset which was divine and on the side which I Also some of the alcoholic the Oasis Sunset come in a nice souvenir glass which I was able to keep I will definitely be back to this magical spot which I have the whenever I am visiting It was such an unbelievably time before I had to fly back home to dreary New Jerseywas great were tasty enough patio and atmosphere all get a up The sunset was pretty darn gorgeous We chips and dip lettuce don t go for the food for sure Go for the scenic and theGreat food and beautiful of lake Travis Very helpful wait staff Try the Bloody Mary you will not be disappointedI have to say I was worried about this place after reading all the negative regarding service and the food We were looking for our back up restaurant incase the Oasis lived up to its reputation but honestly my family and I had a great time with no Our server was prompt and attentive our was great as well as our and Don t let bad dissuade you give it a try and maybe you be pleasantly like we wereWhile I m not a sucker for tourist traps I am a sucker for unique so to sum up my visit I d say that I m happy that I chose to come to The Oasis while on vacation from Fact of the matter is you just can t find like this back home An added touch was the cute and worthy and unique personal such as writing on the in sharpie and your lock Our service was not terrible and I seen a lot of negative about the service Our waitress was friendly and timely and we always had before we ran out The biggest issue we had was the issue with coming out at different times I was nearly done eating before some people in our party had their food It did take awhile for our food to come out We had no trouble parking and even a ride with someone driving people in for The menu was a little weird I t positive of what to expect and random I had de which was a chicken breast in quest with grilled The bean were different but t taste bad The rice was really good The in our party t bad but maybe a little bland It t taste like back home kind of authenticity or maybe I just can t grasp You could keep your that the cake in The gift shop had cute and unique a lot of which local and local popular I spent a solid on to bring back home but I m also a sucker for Overall it was a good experience Was the food the best I ever had But it t bad certainly not as bad as what some of the have it to be I think that if I ever find myself back in I d come back You really can t beat the viewLake Travis is one of the most beautiful near The OASIS is worth the visit even if it s just for the view Unfortunately this place always a wait and especially because of covid they had an even longer wait due to a capacity as well as social being enforced For safety face are and the staff are compliant with all social as well After being seated again it was a long wait but definitely worth it my and I were seated at a table in the rear outdoor seating area We had an absolutely stunning view of Lake Travis and our table felt very private and secluded thanks to social I ended up the perfect margarita for my drink and the fish for my entree The food was delicious and came out in a timely manner The menu are a bit but the view and atmosphere make up for it Overall the best restaurant for scenery in P S the OASIS does not take ahead of arrivalI absolutely love the view here The food is good not great and they re a little but it s definitely worth it to come hereOn I took my to oasis for a drink and the view and it did not disappoint Sitting on a cliff edge lake Travis is oasis What a setting Spectacular We around two and spent two sitting outside and enjoying the view My had the strawberry margarita which she and I stuck with a miller light I was to try a hurricane but I was driving and if anyone about traffic it is not good to drive Unfortunately we did not have any food but from I hear it s If you are looking for rated food or five star service you will leave disappointed Yet all the people who us and us were very nice and outgoing We really our visit and will come back Reminder this place does get busy during sunset so I suggest you come early and try to avoid the traffic There is a lot of parking which is good Again the view is spectacularBeautiful spot Lake Travis The view from the different is amazing so it is worth a visit for that alone There is not a lot of food choice and it is though the we ordered was a good portion and tasted pretty good as well The are not cheap either but also a good size and on mine at least they t skimp on the alcohol So if you want to have a light with a great view this is a good spotand the scenery is probably what you have read are on point and watching sunset is a sight to behold especially if you are visiting for the first time Service is acceptable Staff was friendly and did what they were hired for This place can get busy so most likely they are thin so that is to be I really wished they let me upstairs though but they only open it up on the if they can t handle the capacity downstairs If you can get upstairs DO IT Best view Here is where you get a piece instead of a Food though is still not on elite I remember back in the day you the food and you just came here for the scenery and weekend dancing which is all you really for However with the transformation of this area and now is a touristy area you think the food would have turned a but their are very dry The sides are good though so there are something worth speaking positively about Overall though a person like me put food as priority I also knew this t the place known for that so it t be fair to hit them lower than They do everything else solid There are food trucks on and unless you want to risk choking on dry at the OasisGood food good view usually pretty good customer service sort of far away from where I live It s a fun excursion though and if you re out on a boat it s a great way to end the evening If it s hot though and no breeze it s torture but that s in general Am I rightCame here with a friend for dinner and was ill prepared with no reservation I m on and she is a high risk pregnancy so this definitely t our move and the line is extensive but one of the us out of the line after waiting about and brought us to a table on one of the upper We did not ask for that and were mostly prepared for the hour wait we were told it would be but she went out of her way to seat us sooner which was greatly The view here is stunning so it s a place I d recommend for anyone visiting even if you only come for chips and a drink to knock you off your hello my old friend But really they limit every guest to TWO here Oh and they come in a commemorative glass you can take home That being said The Oasis the BEST I have found in and I lived here my whole life It is the perfect amount of chunky with the right amount of heat and insanely fresh I could drink this stuff it s really that good I ordered the Vegetarian Stuffed and it was fairly tasty I do wish it came with more rice because it s a little spicy but the pepper itself is a huge size and the are very good It would be lovely if they added a meat option because that would make it even better but I would still order this again For I ordered a Mango Perfect Margarita and one of the since my friend was driving The margarita was tasty but t have much of a kick but there is a reason they only let you have two That puppy was STRONG with a very overwhelming flavor of pineapple If you are to come here I highly recommend making a reservation well in advance to avoid the insane but also be aware that the are often an overwhelming number of tables so don t expect them to always be present They are friendly but a person can only do so much when they have other tables they re taking care of as well That being said they are pretty good at your needs extra water chips The Oasis is a really cool spot and I would definitely encourage you to check it out The food is but you are definitely paying for the location as well so it s worth it in my opinion Beautiful beautiful and a great dinner spot to watch the sunset Oh and they often have live music on the upper floor to listen to while you wait for your table in the event you forgot to make a reservation so they say they don t take but I definitely had an entire room reserved before so maybe haveWe drove from San and the view was amazing as to be If you re drinking definitely get a margarita The food was mediocre for the price but our visit s saving grace was our waitress Amy B Per her She was more than attentive and extremely helpful when I ordered a drink I t too of and quickly got me another I will be back because of herI found this place when searching for unique and I immediately knew I had check it out It s about a minute one way drive with no traffic from downtown but definitely worth it for the amazing and unique setting I had a group of and found myself walking around the restaurant looking at all the unique and sunset more than I was at our table The food is pretty basic and nothing special but not bad either More like upscale bar food I had the chicken breast with a side of fruit My group their specialty and the service was great We went on a slow night so we were seated immediately and pretty much had the entire place to ourselves They told us it on and busy nights A must visit for sunset while you are inI was an amazing view and not very good food before going here for a family reunion The view was amazing and with my low expectation of the food it was actually pretty good I think it was the pizza flat bread that was the best thing we had but not just like good like legit deliciousThe at sunset are so amazing they get and the boost up those The sad sad thing is that the food butt I just don t understand why they can t hire a decent chef when their can easily afford one How can you screw up and Give me a spicy thick and I can tolerate most but here it is runny and blah I want so badly want to love this place Management PLEASE hire a new chef and revamp menu rating is based on for a view that booze and for the food Make at sunsetAmazing view The food is good but the view is just unreal You have to go there and experience it at least oncethis is my time here first time back in the s before kitchen fire in and again today the oasis came back bigger and better the view beyond gorgeous a great view of God s country the food is consistently good and of course i cant remember what had in the past before yelp but today we had watery with broken tortilla chips to start good but annoying the bees were out like crazy had to change tables because they wouldnt leave me and my margarita alone we had the margarita had better had the frozen strawberry margarita better friend had a few glasses of nice had the fish s with a side of rice and really good it s a legacy GOI been here a couple of times for both the general restaurant and a private event It s a great place for a chill evening with good The private event space was nice and a great opportunity to gather the family to celebrate are good to great Food is pretty average I m vegetarian so I don t remember eating all that much anyways Great spot to take people visiting or new toI m not sure if we went on a good day given the bad but we our food The view was amazing and the service was goodWe sat and relaxed with some chips taking in the I do recommend going later in the day if you plan on for sunset which I recommend you do all the little the sour round the area we re all closed so there t much to do The place is huge I wish there were more to just sit and relax more comfortably get some added somewhereof the lake Food is good I got chicken They serve chips and Plenty of to sit around the restaurant that will keep you shaded from the heatcon vista para La es un poco en y el is margarita yThe place dine in with a fine view of the lake The food are mainly style and the taste is not noticeably delicious when with other establishment What s relatively fresh and good for me is chips here really crunchy and niceWent here last and had a great time with my mother I don t really get a time of free time so I don t go out as much as I used to but this was just what I Our server was very attentive and everything tasted great The only thing was that our entree came out too fast it had been since we had our appetizer and the entree was there Overall great experienceDriving past this place it definitely t look like it in The food was mediocre but the view was great For lunch was So not at all expensive We and Lake Travis We re coming backAlthough it was hot the view was still amazing were all friendly and service was on point Always a great place to grab while enjoying the lake viewGreat place to watch the sun set The are However the food here is only alright and pretty The Hurricane Depression is one of their frozen It was sweet strong and great to sip on Our server was super energetic and kindThis place amazing on beautiful days I t bother on overcast days or if I t sit outside We went there for and a light lunch The Oasis Cooler was delicious and pretty strong I had the shrimp lettuce They were good but not great I would definitely order them again but I m going there for the view and not the shrimpfood rating out of based on for and shrimp chicken for two Owner is kind and accommodating Waitress was patient sweet and a great joy to have serving my family of for dinner My family went to the Oasis around for dinner on a night There was a long line just to place in our name for a reservation I was waiting in line with my grandmother as my the car Before the owner us waiting in line and immediately and graciously for us to follow him because he was going to seat us right away with a view of Lake Travis This was such an altruistic act I would have written a review alone on that This is my first review as I see minimal use in rating average to eat or already with a sufficient Our waitress was very sweet at dinner can require a lot of patience and understanding On a busy night these are two you cannot find anywhere but she spent as much time providing and my my grandmother make her dinner She was always smiling and willing to take the time to make sure we had a fantastic experience cannot describe the service we received By the way the sunset during dinner the lake and mountainous range was spectacular The food was good but not out of this world We were of this but to see the view as said there is no better place to grab dinner with a view my mother and I live in New and were visiting for a few days Definitely a recommend during sunset to see the viewbeautiful view friendly staff food and I got a fruit margarita and a salad The salad t even that good Salad dressing was on the side with and plus extra for shrimp The total came out to be around after tax expensive for a light lunch Overall I d come here again for a drinkThis was a great way to kickoff our Memorial Day weekend trip We by lunch at the Oasis Their salmon was a bit dry but this was by their strong and the beautiful view Lots of in the area to walk around when you re finished eating The restaurant had plenty to look at some really beautiful bronze We the owner rebuilt the place after a fire in He did a great job This will be the place to go on Lake Travis for to comeThe band Train was it was an awesome time Older crowd We only had and beef The were good however service big time Service was than molasses I think because the crowd was too much for the small amount of staff Beautiful view of the lakewhat a view of lake Travis this place is Amazing Sitting on a Mountain View of beautiful lake Travis just down the road from downtown There are a number of in this amazing complex at least and a number of gift But the real deal is the view I did mention that I had the good fortune to see the Mediterranean from Morocco which is amazing but not much Beer is cold is goodFood Was there this weekend and menu and I suspect the chef as well We were a big party and Crystal was great serving usI came here for a and the view is amazing The overlook of Lake Travis really the dining experience After reading the poor of the food here I came in with low but the food was surprisingly good There was a buffet that had chicken pork and beef The pork was really sweet but the chicken and beef were pretty solid The tortilla was a bit dry but all in all pretty decentThe food is but the view is amazing That s why I rated it However if you do choose to eat outside the have heat that keep you warm during the coldThe food is but the view is amazing That s why I rated it However if you do choose to eat outside the have heat that keep you warm during the coldMost beautiful view in but they charge for chips and which is a big star The food t great but the experience is worth ittrust me when I say I read pretty much all of the bad on this place I m giving it and even I can say I m My husband and I came here on our anniversary trip from and were so excited to come here I almost decided not to because I was turned off from all of the bad We came here on a night to catch the sunset so I knew it was going to be busy We actually only had to wait and then we were seated Our waitress was and she was so sweet and attentive were a little bit slow but we t mind because we knew that there was so much going on We ordered the perfect margarita and it was good but it definitely a bit more alcohol I ordered the shrimp and I thought they were great My husband ordered the chicken club and he was satisfied Our chips and tasted great so we were happy Watching the sun set was absolutely incredible and I the atmosphere If you re a and going to nit pick everything don t come here But if you re chill and looking for a unique place to go I definitely recommendLove this place Food is great nothing special but the view is priceless Definitely will come backThe Oasis is beautiful You can t beat sitting on the patio Lake Travis on a sunny day or during the evening while the sun is setting how amazing is the view The service is not good at all We came here and for a seat on the patio and there were many open tables however the hostess sat us at a table directly in the sun We the waitress could we move and she said she would fix the umbrella so that the sun would not glare into our the entire time Well that t work out so she us and she t happy about it at all It s not that bad They should work on their The food was good I the coconut shrimp with rice I ate every bit I also had a taste of the fish which were also I will come back here for the view if nothing elsePrior to our visit I was aware of all the poor about the quality of food here For that reason we decided to come here solely for dessert and the view You truly do feel like you re in the middle of an oasis You could spend looking at the of Lake Travis because it even more beautiful at night from what I in the We in the afternoon and found parking in a lot with dirt no concrete a little dirty for those coming in with BANANA Delicious blend of banana and pineapple and rum Not the best I ever had but it did the job for a hot summer day PERFECT MARGARITA This was a lot lighter and easier to drink Again not the but still refreshing RED VELVET CHEESECAKE We originally ordered the cheesecake and the server brought us this and that it was the cheesecake It t it was still fine Just a simple dessert You can t really come here with to get good food unfortunately However it s still a great time if you come to enjoy the view and take in the experience for what it is There are also some surrounding the area outside of the restaurant Definitely worth a visit just don t come hungry PARKING Available for free in the lotThis place is good You will see some bad but I can see why It s huge and some tables have nice and some don t It s bit hectic during busy time so service can be questionable too Don t forget People who have bad most likely come here and leave bad I been visiting this place since and only goodI had low coming to this restaurant because of all of the negative on Yelp but I really my dinner here We sat outside on the patio at night and it was cold but they had heat scattered around to keep us warm It was dark before we got there so we the sunset but the other half of our party got there before us and from the I saw it beautiful The free tortilla chips were really good I think they fry them or something because they re super crispy and crunchy I t very hungry so I just ordered the Tortilla Soup It was good but a little than I I had a bite of my sister s just to taste it but I ended up eating the whole thing because it was good We were a birthday and they brought out for the birthday girl This was definitely the highlight of the meal besides the chips It comes with cinnamon in honey with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream in the middle They don t do separate but they will accept as many credit as you want You just mark your name on the receipt next to the you want to charge to your card You can also keep the plastic Oasis water after your meal as a souvenirThe area is worth out if you re visiting I went right as they on morning and unfortunately it was I decided to dine out on the patio to enjoy the warm breeze which had a very nice view The service was great with friendly staff and attentive The complimentary chips and are so good Since it was my first meal of the day I ate so much of it plus it t help that I ordered a margarita D For our main plate my sis and I split the fish and chicken enchilada so the food is and mediocre but it s a great place to sit snack drink and enjoy the atmosphere and view After we and I was out in the parking lot I saw our waiter run out and had a feeling he was looking for us but after we confirmed we had our wallet we just left Of course later that night it finally on me that I left my I and confirmed and went in the evening to pick it up that s when we the live music upstairs Great place to get together with or family to enjoy a night outWe were super worried about a bad experience because of all negative Frankly we were just going to stop in for and the view but ended up for dinner and had a great night The view is quite wonderful I d definitely recommend taking any or family that are visiting here You and at the view and you never be able to afford and it s glorious Maybe we just got lucky I hate to say that because I want to give Oasis the benefit of the doubt or came on a good day but from start to finish everything was great for us The hostess was super friendly and up and down with us as we a spot near the edge of the Our waitress was very accommodating and attentive getting us more before we could ask and such Our food was fine perhaps not the I spent on fine but I had no taste wise were great my guava margarita was and the his pina Only real fuss was that the food took an incredibly long time to arrive but our waitress acknowledged it and wholeheartedly so we simply took in the view while we Would back back again for the view and definitely anotherThis was my first time here Super cute and it The view was amazing you got to see the sunset They did cleaning and sat people away from The food was good I had a chicken club and it was very goodThis is certainly a destination in the area The are quite pretty looking over Lake Travis The bar is inside can be a bit cramped depending on the day of the week the are also quite also And a large selection to suit everyone s taste We did have to wait for an outside table about on a so I t think that was bad Our table was and our server was very good however the food service was pretty slow but they were extremely busy We order Chips which you have in right We also had some fried egg roll like which were really good sorry I don t remember what they were Would I go back Sure it would be fun with a group of people actually the day we were there a couple got engaged which was fun to see I don t think I would be a regular here but it s a fun change of pace and there are a few little there to stroll through alsoWe ordered the chicken and shrimp and for the appetizer we ordered the double dip which is and The are strong and good The VIEW is EVERYTHING Our waitress was phenomenal We our lunch hereBEST in Food was service was excellent Make a reservation get there early and watch the sunsetAt first it t look as much Then we where at at our table and that view is The sever was friendly and the menu delicious foodMy other to take me here for my birthday and I was happy to oblige Not knowing anything about the place I was curious to explore the surroundings I ordered the beef for one and was by how much food was brought out Even though I t eat it all I put up quite a showing In spite of how good the food and service was not sure I would ever choose to come here under normal This is such a date or special place I would hardly have reason for visiting Once we all were finished eating and the food was settling in our my brother and I found a nearby coffee place while the ladies Eventually we it good and headed to the car If I ever have a special reason for making the trek I would definitely come here for the appropriateGreat spot to view the sunset Great food despite what had said We had beef and shrimp and shrimp so good are too sweet but other then that awesome food and serviceEat again Maybe Overall The best thing about this place is the view Eating here around sunset is so nice However the food is nothing special and pretty expensive Also you can t make so you can expect a minute wait on average around sunset dinner time Favorite dish mango fruit margarita I got a margarita and was very pleasantly It tasted great and I would totally recommend this Also got chicken shrimp cocktail The chicken was pretty average although it was quite a bit of food for one person The shrimp cocktail was also it came with about shrimp in a cup Ambience Again the setting is what this place special It s pretty cool to walk around and browse through the and take in the view AAtmosphere Cleanliness Service Food Likelihood Best My first visit to the Oasis My first time to What a great location The is second to none that I have seen SO beautiful It was pretty clean I was for better food quality and better service I saw on the floor none of them engaged in touching tables that I saw in my area I saw different None stopped at our table We had more of an order taker not a server I almost got up to get my own twice I was eating with nothing to drink The food was warm not hot My chicken was over very dry for s I would go again Not too soon It is a most beautiful destinationThe view of lake Travis is beautiful The ride to Oasis is pretty nice since it s The food was I the sight more than anything You re pretty much paying for the lovely view Service t terrible I may come back again in the future for a drink and the viewThe speak for themselves It is really beautiful out there You are seated on that have a wonderful view of Lake Travis The food is good but really I d recommend coming here for the and good company The shrimp are better than the fish but both were tastyThe oasis is a destination for many I been here countless times throughout the last The and location are amazing The whole complex and there are so many to offer This place really is a one time experience because every time I go there again I m always wishing the food could get better This is the perfect place to bring out of town and to drink while watching amazing But if you re wanting to go there for a great dinner it s just not a place worth It could be because it s so many that the food is cold from traditional but it also could just be that everything like it s made in the microwave Don t get me wrong I definite recommendation the oasis for a first time experience You and you guest will love it Atmosphere the review but still the food quality needs workWow is the best way to describe it A nice sunny day with a beautiful view You definitely don t feel like you re in We ordered the beef and chicken Let s not forget the Both the food and were I see why this place is always The don t do it justice You go check it outI can see this place from my back deck so I don t visit often but when I do it s very enjoyable I choose to visit the brewery on the third floor but they have off and I have up to the second floor on a couple of only to see the entry chained off and a sign posted with for being closed The view While the food t the the beer is always wonderful and the view is amazing When I m here my wife and I always laugh about looking at our back deck but it s still a great time Always busy but the parking garage it much better than parking across the street and the traffic on the main road The staff always been friendly and the view oh that view',\n",

The ambience was cozy and the of the lake was breath taking Both our were on top of everything The food was delicious and you can t leave without trying one of their The was reasonable and their are really good size Overall this will be the spot for myself family and every time I visit Keep up the great work staff at OasisWe stayed in lake Travis for the weekend We decided to stop by the Oasis before leaving We had a great view and great food Majority of our group the It was great If you like spiciness you will love this dishMy wife and I went to this week to visit our daughter and Son In Law who recently to We stopped in for a late lunch on a and despite the negative here were very happy with both the food and the service The food was good and the reasonable The wait was only a few

for the sunset next timeGreat experience Our waitress was super sweet and bubbly Our food came out quickly I d say within ten of The to die for The view is stunning I d highly recommend coming at a time to view the sunset over the lake We ordered the beef both deliciousWe had a great time at the Oasis It can get pretty crowded depending on which night you go It is but you get a beautiful view with your delicious foodTheir is fantastic I t order anything else after that because I just t want to talk to the waiter He with work Or maybe he was just upset because before I sat down he beer on me and I came to tell him about it and his response was I have beer all over me too I for another waiter and he was great and got me some and the manager Everyone else around my waiter was great The service was great Anyways the was dope The chips were dope I always judge a place by its I m sure the rest of the food is good cause the is good Too bad I t feel like talking to my waiterThe view of Lake Travis and the sunset was great as always Good service and our food was deliciousStunning location and facility Had a great lunch for my first time here My sever was very courteous and personable was very accommodating to my company Very professional lively and fun placei guess we went on a good day our meal was fantastic the were perfect we also had the rice and which were also good our service was great could been better but a party of got seated next to us and they were a little demanding the view was amazing we had a good experienceI was at the Oasis this past weekend and it I totally agree with most of the I have read on here about the Oasis the food t great the can be expensive for what you get and the service t great but the view is just off the So I give the Oasis because the view to me just all the down sides I mean it is above the lake and everything It you how beautiful can be when you are not of a flat highway Don t go their for a great meal just take the food for what it is and get a couple and enjoy what got to be one of the top if not the best restaurant view in the StateEVEN WITH NO FOOD OR DRINK THIS PLACE WOULD BE WORTH SPENDING THE EVENING JUST FOR THE VIEW This new and post burned to the ground incarnation is better than ever bigger more attractive without being too modern or antiseptic or ordinary food is far better than it was before and the view is as good as ever go there in the late afternoon and stay through sundown Just remember lest you get by the fairly slow and lackadaisical service leave your watch at home when you go here get into the moment slow down and watch the horizon JUST IGNORE ALL THE OBNOXIOUS I M SO PRETTY YOUNG RICH GLAMOROUS NEWLY LOOK AT ME AND NOTICE THAT MOST OF THE CROWD IS REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND MEAwesome scenery huge and great spicy chicken sandwich It s cool that chips are free and the service was pretty good despite it being super crowded Drove from to come definitely worth the almost hour driveWOW what a view After eating we just sat in the front court yard a great meal in the stone wooden gazebo They have gift that you can throw your money away on and bring back for the only draw back the waiter ass I had to collect from our table and walk them up to the bar to get Till the manger saw me doing this and I guess he cracked the whip Because I d take a sip and he d run over if I was good yeah thanks I can t wait to come back to this placeAs a person with severe food and many bad at other my experience at Oasis out as one of the most positive on a very busy night the chef came to my table and to me about what I could eat a beautiful with completely from scratch and personally brought it to my table It was simply delicious and worth the price to be able to enjoy a meal with family and and feel great the next day Every one else in our group of fifteen had an enjoyable experience as well The were delicious and beautifully the Flan delightful and so creamyThis place They offer anything and everything Amazing food great Did I mention the view It s absolutely perfectstar for sure Food is pretty good also your typical fare Our service was pretty great despite our large group size so that s a plus also I ordered a margarita my waiter wisely pointed out that I should upgrade to a gold margarita for only more It was a fantastic margarita For food the chips and to start out with were tasty The house salad with chicken was a perfect light but satisfying meal for my health conscious self just for that day though I also had some of the you can t go wrong with those Overall food was yummy were better and company made it the best experience I recommend a visitAlthough this place is this is one of the biggest of my recent trip to You can t beat the You can t beat the sunset You can t believe you are sitting up in the and the most beautiful scenery and possible Service is slow but understandable because they are super busy on the The fish were outstanding They have live on the weekend on the third floor terrace I recommend going up there to sit since you will have the best view and there is typically a very long wait time if you sit in the main dinner room on the bottom floor Definitely going againWe had our son s rehearsal dinner there two ago and it t have gone better The food was outstanding Everyone We had some diet and all were met with grace and tasted great too We had our own private deck with no from the general public Our attendant was so good that we tipped him more on top of the gratuity that was part of the bill I would recommend their staff in a heartbeat Thank you for the start of a great wedding weekendWe ate here for Mother s Day brunch and the food and service were exceptional Great view of Travis Lake tooThis was our first visit and we went as soon as it I wish I could say more about the food IT WAS AMAZING I got the and my husband got the bacon wrapped shrimp both were fantastic View awesome and our server was the right kind of attentivenessthis place was gorgeous and we got excellent service The food was amazing and it made our trip We will definitely be back and tell all ouramazing view while u eat and drink

our and they us right away and gave us a table inside with a great view as well Our server was incredibly sweet and even let my year old son order off the menu with no problem he s very picky The food was very good and came quick My chicken were extremely flavorful and the up their fruit After eating we spent an hour exploring the Oasis The gift shop some unique but what we really was the building next door It All were closed but they were so beautiful we took advantage of some photography time Our time here was enjoyable and fun I will say that we did go at on a and it was not too busy which I

to our table outside lake side The server was friendly and us to the menu A photographer is on site and to take a couple of with Lake Travis behind us The charge is to obtain the photo for possession but hey it s our first time and visit to why not The food was pretty good we ordered the which was alright had better elsewhere as for the they were plentiful and flavorful and the rice was good not rice though and the were All in all for a first time visit it was an experience probably make another visit in in the future for a drink and appetizer this time Highly recommend to people not familiar with Lake Travis to give this place a try it is truly an experienceSTAR for the scenery but the food was just My partner and I was just there for the st time and we live for a beautiful scenery Service was fantastic as wellI had read several other of this restaurant and certainly understand their frustration with wait time to get in and OUR experience was different since we came as part of a wedding party s rehearsal dinner so we right in to the reserved room with food and ready This venue to be the outdoor restaurant in it with event that can hold up to people Wow no wonder it is so busy There are of outdoor eating facing beautiful Lake Travis a lake to control flooding ago now expensive real estate property It was the night we were there the building kind of us of a type atmosphere but it was a lovely venue and had beautiful scenery for all to enjoy and rememberI guess maybe hit and miss Can t figure out why the are so bad If I had to pick one thing it would be not enough people clearing the tables other than that the food was great Staff great Atmosphere was Amazing Amazing It s a must to come back We even got the birthday free brownie and itI been going to The Oasis for almost and have experienced it s and in of service On my last visit myself and my family had the most exceptional experience The manager and our waitress Cassie went above and beyond to make sure that we had the best experience we could have us after the hostess station told us that it would be an hour wait for a table by the water We had been sat at a cramped table near the front door but saw us picked up our high chair and us to a private room where my daughter could crawl around on the floor Cassie brought us every possible assortment of so that my daughter had a variety of soft to eat Then we were toward the best possible and After the meal we went and bought candy at the candy store which was amazing candy by the way and some fun at their store where the girl personally wrapped the up with paper and ribbon so we could give the away as Then we were picked up by golf cart at the gate and driven to our car Amazing amazing afternoon Thank you for that to my family and giving us such wonderfulI was apprehensive going here with all the negative but I disagree with many here and that was on a rainy day was friendly and efficient Food was great I had shrimp and will order them again Will definitely go again Such a pretty restaurantIf Yelp closed for today call We did and it was open on a the view and the people We were the everyone about and we really it Had the shrimp that a lady next to us also had Both agreed it was good We had the It had an interesting flavor though t taste much due to the sauce We would definitely come back when in the area againThe view from any level is great The band was fantastic and the margarita was very different The fish were delicious being this was my first attempt It s worth the tripWe brought from China here to watch the sunset It was amazing Some of our said that it was one of the most beautiful they have experienced The and were fantastic us with a huge smile and was very patient We will be backThe waiting line at oasis is out to the parking lot But we through the entire thing in and had a table the water in no time Service was great food was fantastic They have rebuilt the place to accommodate more people so getting a table is not a problem And regarding the romantic scene That is not up to a restaurant that is up to you The sunset is up to flavor of the day and the people around you is up to chance Oasis the opportunity to see a sunset be around people and for good food so that all you have to do is the romance partONLY go here for the view gorgeous FREE view FREE music too then go eat somewhere else food is and not very goodis their speciality and they do it well There are about different on several different inside and out at this place It s amazing just from a size perspective guess they really do make everything bigger in The view of Lake Travis is also something special Perfect Margarita was just that Not too sweet not too weak not too strong Just perfect Being I m always by menu s This time was no different Made due with their lettuce wrap with black instead of meat cheese Tasty and enough food so I t hungry Lori had with sweet potato and Cole slaw and our friend had Both tell me they we re good but rib did not fall off the bone like my wife All in all very nice place with good food and drink with a great location and viewThis place an amazing view and the food certainly The atmosphere is great and the met many people from every all over After dinner we were able go shopping at the little surrounding this beautiful place a walk through the up Also got to hear some live music and dance Would certainly go back and would recommend this place to anyoneI m writing a review on the view from the Oasis and from the not actually on the restaurant The view even on a cloudy day is beautiful I went on a evening prime time sunset on I had about going to see the sunset thinking it might be too crowded and too touristy but I m so glad I saw it There is ample parking so there is no need to valet Yes it was full of people walking around or sitting There are some opening up so that there s for people to do there while they wait for their meal I read the and saw that the food is less than mediocre Now it you have time i suggest going on a night with live music and you can danceMy wife and I had our vow renewal at the sunset villa in the Oasis We were both very at how well Sam and the rest of the crew did in perfecting our night I would recommend this place to anyone They truly know how to provide great serviceI m super sad this place t have a high review I just this weekend from for my birthday and found this place I came only for the view due to all the bad i read I m so glad still came Th view was absolutely stunning The food was amazing as well Our server was awesome too We every minute of it The wait was about which was fine for a night But we had so many other to grab a drink while we I would not go by all the negative they write on here Thank God I still came and did not go by what the said Super happy with everything Thank you for making my birthday special and that viewI give this place my best rating because of the scene the FRESH on a half shell and the I grew up by the ocean and I love and they are extremely hard to get up here and even harder to get them fresh and great tasting They are a bit though Come here on a weekday and skip the family frenzy The restaurant on the side of a hill that over Lake Travis Talk about breath taking This place is so romantic too I think this place poor because if you go here too often the originality really offI love visiting this place The owner is a great guy view is spectacular and staff is super friendlyGreat place for a great view and a great meal As a I just ordered but my wife a with From what she me the was greatFood was great Bloody Mary was made to perfection service was immediate and the were awesome Do not listen to the at a minimumGreat place to bring family and Beautiful scenery

everything was taken care of reservation only We got an amazing view and an amazing waitress I believe her name is you want to reserve your spot in advance because it will fill up fast I believe they had for their Brunch The food was AMAZING There was a Omelette bar A waffle bar A BAR like WHAT We had unlimited King Crab And they were so meaty and delicious The BEST crab I ever had Along with fresh shrimp and smoked salmon There was a huge dessert section that was to die for TWO chocolate like that s pretty awesome Along with beautiful There was a appetizer section with A huge salad bar

casual dinner and next Mother s DayOne Word Magical Me and my family came from out of town and just it The Oasis was everything I and The food was great service was great music was great and gift shop also great I really recommend this placePlease ignore the low rating The food and in this restaurant are fine the view is SPECTACULAR there is museum quality and sculpture galore I consider this venue a MUST SEE on any trip to We were delighted that our hotel Residence Inn Lake River Place is a minute drive from The Oasis This is a popular place to watch the sun set but we the spectacular Lake Travis view during the daytime as well We commend one of the who is friendly cheerful and a GREAT ambassador for the restaurant I the tuna salad a grapefruit juice and Jack neat no ice I several reviewer about watered down this is it s HOT outside the ice probably melt on their way from the bar to your table why don t you consider a drink with no iceStop in and make your own mind up Don t listen to these bad I almost did not go because of them but then I that it is stupid to base your decision off of on the Many of the here are trivial and ridiculous The food was amazing I am a big food person and my group of all ordered different Every single thing we got was so great from to to chicken to many The wait was very long but that was and we accordingly If you are upset at a long wait time right before sunset their most popular time and you miss sunset that s your problem not the restaurant Expect to wait at least an hour on the but trust me it is well worth it Special shout out to he was amazing We came from for a b day trip and went above and beyond service wise I worked as a server and manager in for He was the best Long story short Ignore the picky nagging tourist and see for yourselfthis is the first time i been to oasis and despite the here i thought it was great we picked first available seating since we t on eating there and the were pretty hungry we t sit near the lake but we still being outside and were still able to see the water my really it too they were excited to see the water i ordered the tuna salad it my husband ordered the smoked chicken and got a up from him he also their perfect margarita on the the much more loaded than what other have it was a lot of food for my so we took it home but she to like it my other ordered the pizza and ate

Sunset Villa Room on and I have to say that it was superb and wonderful Shipman the Wedding worked with us to make sure that our big day was just the way that we it She was always available to answer and never made me feel uncomfortable even when I to see more than once or in a variety of ways She was down to earth and super easy to talk to about my wedding reception She and the staff worked diligently to set everything up just the way I it and once we they were VERY attentive to our every need I never went thirsty or hungry as they brought me whatever I desired The venue was lovely especially the wrap around deck and the bank of They even decorated for the with that to be in the same colors as the reception cranberry red aquamarine blue and silver Lucky me We also had some specific the food tasting such as making sure the brisket was not dry and lo and behold the brisket was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS The appetizer of chicken were a big hit and rather quickly The chicken was delicious as was the grilled asparagus The cheesy potatoes could have been a little but they did get with time The ranch were really yummy too Overall it was a magical day for us The location venue s beauty staff service and food really came together to make our reception truly memorable Thank you and the OasisLove this place Always new on the menu Staff is great All seating have a great view Today we came with my grandma she with a walker I was amazed that we got a spot right outside no that my grandma had to deal with And with an amazing view Talk about accommodatingDon t come here for the food are awesome More of a drink spot The shrimp was so bad I only had a couple Think shrimp just smothered in a bad sauce Service is as well As if we were more of a burden Never again unless it s just to out and drinkGreat place to have dinner and out with beautiful sunset view and great foodAnyone a visit to should carve out time to enjoy dinner or while watching the sunset at the Oasis They make a big deal over the sun setting so don t miss it The view is stunning and the food is good Slightly but certainly worth it if you are on vacationLet me just say that I was very hesitant about eating here because of the It was for a birthday dinner and since we are from I figured the would be worth the trip to The Oasis for dinner anyway We around on May th and were promptly on a hour wait We this so it t an issue We went to the brewery upstairs and some dinner My party was sat right around the hour and a half mark We immediately ordered and We were that the kitchen was slightly backed up but our and very quickly I can t remember the name of the appetizer but it was bacon wrapped chicken smothered in some kind of sauce and by a ranch they were delicious There were five people in our party and we all our main My husband got the chicken steak while I ordered the fish with rice and black All the food was flavorful especially the As a I enjoy a particularly good batch of and although it may be weird to comment on something so specific as I must say they were my favorite I could have eaten a bowl of the black by themselves Anyway I always believe in trying a place despite negative and I m so happy we did I had a colleague from work visiting the same weekend who on The Oasis based on the After I sent her and my approval of the food she was upset of her decision She is making to go back soon and will add this to her list I say give this place a try and worst case scenario you enjoy some great with an amazing viewThe food t the best but you can t beat the view If you have family or visiting from out of town I would highly recommend the OasisThe view is spectacular and the service was really good They serve you complimentary chips and which was really good My friend ordered the chicken which was really good and I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp with I m not a big fan of salt and of coarse with the bacon my dish was a little too salty for me but it was still very goodIce cold drink Lake view heaven Go here for a nice day or night along Lake Travis Order yourself a delicious drink a strawberry margarita in my case and some heavenly Relax drink eat laugh and enjoy your time here No point in feeling rushed as there are so MANY outdoor available I personally love coming here after a hot outdoor excursion during the summer I always order an ice cold and a strawberry margarita t get much better Great place to cool downIt s been at least since I last came here it was awful and haven t been back until tonight and wow what a difference before the waiting list got a beautiful outside table under a gazebo then had the waiter introduce himself SAM star and attentive service Star The were excellent the food was wonderful I don t know when I have had a better experience lately in star if I could give more I would The place is now a destination spot and they have done a fantastic job We felt comfortable non rushed and able to enjoy the beautiful sunset Thank you for a wonderful experience and I will be back with more to experience this wonderful gemI had a large daytime Casino and Presentation corporate event here in the Starlight Terrace back in March for people at the Oasis t be easier to work with and so great overall I have many large and for my company and I would say that tops the list of making my life easier and helping to make the day a HUGE success The day of I was with a huge Oasis crew to help me setup and prepare for the day which went off without a hitch We had which were great I know food may not be their strong suit but everyone in my group We also had some and who could just order off the menu The venue is so cool and the essence of in my opinion If you are looking to host any size of corporate event or wedding rehearsal dinner or what have you talk to at the OasisAs an Native I had previously gone to the Oasis many ago as a child This was fire so I had zero going in this last time I have since to but was my wedding in and a place to host my rehearsal dinner I sent out to about and The Oasis event staff was the easiest to work with They immediately out and sent me an with all of the information laid out They gave me a lot to work with on a menu and let me exactly what I as long as I the minimum per person I got the Lone Star Room with a private balcony at sunset and the were STUNNING The Oasis staff did a wonderful job providing my of choice and fresh flower on each table We had a private bar and bartender for my They also have a sound system and a way to show a to your While there they were able to accommodate a few extra food on the spot It was the easiest experience when it came to wedding It was all taken care of for me and they were more than happy to do it I highly recommend for a couple looking for a rehearsal dinner space You already have so much to figure out this should be the easy part I should also add that they are on top of their security We had a random party crasher that was an issue and we had a police officer present within five My were not disturbed and it was handled discreetly We could not be happier with our experience at The Oasis and if we ever have another dinner party in we will definitely be calling them up againScenery is the best The food and were great The weather was not the best although we still had an awesome experience Can t wait to go backfor the food for the view comes out to about Seriously don t come here an amazing meal the place something like people so expect the food to be standard and basic Some are actually pretty decent If you can t stand the thought of mediocre just out upstairs at the bar and have some The reason you come is for the view It s amazing It s totally satisfying to take out of here who to be a dry dusty and flat wastelandBest view in The visit to this restaurant made my entire trip I don t understand the poor The food and were great I will admit that our service t exceptional we got our food quickly though he just t visit many more times after that but was very sweet A must during any visit toBeautiful view Great food very large We had beef for one and they were enough for people My pork were so so good I d definitely order them again We it all It took a while for I think it was they have to climb a lot of and go far away for them But they also give you water We prob min at for a table That s not to bad make sure you get a text saying your waiting on a table to start with or your not in the systemHad a wonderful experience took great care of us They even let us eat upstairs in the closed section The food was great not to mention the viewThis will become your new favorite place in Don t mind their mess they are but you won t know it when sitting on their deck and drinking a margaritaof Lake Travis amazing and great service was exceptional in our needs and truly provided hospitalityFood is dry and like cardboard but man who with a view like that In all seriousness though they need to put have more pride in their menu and how it comes out to I rate for the atmosphere and on foodOasis great food and great service and the and there are so nice and funny we gave the waiter a tip I RECOMMEND this placeHighly recommend The were delicious the food was so good and the service was amazing Our server Sam was cute and courteous the were super helpful and the manager made a point to check in which I love I wish I could have stayed even longerWe came here for a work event and it No long for the bar the were awesome and flowing the band was FABULOUS Due to the cloudiness of the night we did not get to experience the beautiful sunset The view of the lake was still very beautiful and nice to stand at the railing and talk with They brought in a bull for everyone to ride and a nice gift shop is on site I thought the food was good that they had water available for those of us who struggle with the heat in Lots of room for us to dance to the great music that was provided The open air feeling while being under cover was truly a great way to experience there was a nice breeze that picked up during the night that to cool it downThe sunset view is unforgettable The food was not that bad however it took us one and an half hour to get a seat thoughThe oasis is a great place to go with family to watch a beautiful sunset with friendly staff and good its a must if u r visitingOn a trip from to San we took a day to travel to This was one of the we hit for The weather and view was SPECTACULAR Our waitress was but did the best she could with serving us The manger on duty was AWESOME as he out when he could even giving our table an extra umbrella for shade Unfortunately when we we were told there was a hour wait We out to take a view before getting back in line and saw there were MULTIPLE open tables We took a seat and was promptly Glad we to take in our own Will returnThis place is one of my favorite to have a delicious meal with an unforgettable view with family or I eaten here many times and recently forgot a pair of expensive and the manager was very helpful in finding them for us and in communication They take care of their and have GREAT all around Will definitely be coming backThe view is amazing totally worth it Food is very good We went there around and t have to wait at all But waiting time are insane if u go on dinner or lunchWe just ate here and were very I read the and thought try it anyways Well I am glad I did not listen to the other Great view wonderful atmosphere Our waitress was very friendly very prompt The were decent My and I recommend tou ditch the bad and give this place a tryProbably my favorite place in The food t AMAZING but it s really good and so is the service and the view cannot be beat I go here every time inI m not sure what the negative are about We are visiting my daughter and her family from San and had dinner here tonight Everything we was wonderful The Service was our server the Food the We had the combination for two two of the Perfect and everything was Definitely a return visit next time we are in Peace GI absolutely love to visit the Oasis When family we take them to the Oasis It is always a big hit The art and various around the property are ever and always interesting The owner was kind enough to welcome us to his establishment as if we were old We felt very welcome and greatly our visit The food often a bad rep but honestly in my I was with all of my In fact the food is not bad I tried the crawfish yummy My wife had the beef I am not sure if that is right but it sure eats good according to her I forgot to mention the view It is superb I was told by the staff that the lake is down substantially as a result of the lack of rainfall in this year Te view is still awesome I recommend first time to to make The Oasis a destination Once you visit you will want to return and bring The more the My only gripe was our waitress on one visit She could have made her a bit more Expect a wait for seating around sunset since this is the main attraction of the Oasis Also if meeting they cannot seat your party until everyone noIt was already for our family to eat dinner at The Oasis for my daughter birthday which was on a that day I had read the for the restaurant and they were mostly bad which made me want to change the location for the dinner But we decided to stick to our and I m glad we did When we there was an hour to an hour and a half wait to get a table outside but we got seated within During our wait we were able to go see the small gift shop they have there And I saw that there was a few of the waitress waiting on the like I saw in a picture from another review but from what I they were just waiting on getting The customer service was great our waitress came frequently to check on us They were nice enough to keep a cake we took in the back till we were ready bring it out and the strawberry were good Everybody their food I had Red Fish it had a good flavor was good I did order the it was decent but it could use a bit more of flavor Of course the view was amazing We would definitely be visiting againAt my cousin s wedding This place is amazing I have no idea how high up we were Lake Travis maybe Wedding was on the balcony the lake It was sweltering but the venue had which made it tolerable Ceremony was short and sweet Space was perfect for a small to medium wedding Bridal suite was on the floor below There was a lot of other business going on at The Oasis but nothing that disturbed the wedding If you are in the area and looking for a wedding venue this is a must seeI just read a lot of the and I think most of you t be happy anywhere you go And its pretty obvious allot of you are either lying or The food is just standard bar food its not fine dining and you don t go to the Oasis for the food you go for the and view and the I to the area ago and whenever I have come into town I take them to the Oasis Over the last I have been X and have never experienced all the and most of you are crying about think most of you are just off ex who got firedGood food and even better A little but someone to pay for that viewWe good food and a phenomenal view They are family friendly and the were clean The place is usually pretty but service was still good I recommend their andHaven t been here in a spell but decided I d like lunch with a view now that the lake is full again thanks you As always the entrance is over the top with natural beauty Our table the lake and i was instantly relaxed But you already know all that here s why I m writing the review the food tremendously since the last time I d Both ordered were absolute perfection I would seriously eat the tuna salad everyday if I could Well worth the drive and well worth the priceMy and I this place for the first time which was on a that week I read some of the and they were bad but also that the water were good So we decided to check it out When we there was a short wait of less than to get a table by the water view My and I were very with the food the view of Lake Travis was amazing and our and were very friendly attentive and fast We will definitely come backFood was very good the service was good also They make probably one of the best in If they could of made the weather a little better I think it would of been a perfect dining experienceI went to the Oasis this morning for a business meeting The Oasis was beautiful as always It is such a fantastic place to have a business meeting Our meeting was in the meeting room on the third floor When I there was an Oasis employee standing in the parking lot near the door and as I the door he if I was there for the meeting I that I was and he directed me to the entrance and said I could take the or the elevator and the meeting was on the third floor That was a fantastic way to greet The meeting room was fabulous We had a great sound system as the were The probably t need them but the sound was good One really cool aspect is that the microphone was even in the bathroom I that We had a really great meal It was chicken with potatoes and green I every bit of it The staff was great at unobtrusively serving everyone during the presentation I think there must have been or people at the meeting The only thing that was bothersome was that there was a brick pillar on one side of the room and I had to kind of jimmy my chair around a little bit so I could see around the pillar It was not as if t was impossible though The wait staff was a class act They were quiet responsive polite and everything you want in a business lunch I have that the food at the Oasis gone down hill in recent but the food we had was just great I guess the last thing is the view the were uncovered for a minute and we had an unparalleled view of Lake Travis It was beautiful All in all it was a great lunch in a great space with great staff I will not mind more in that spaceThe Oasis is great There s something here for everyone The view is amazing Don t be by large crowd because the restaurant is enormous and they are good at seating of people and getting the food out We love this placeThis place the most beautiful view The service was very friendly and food came out very quickly but timely While the wind was a little cool to sit on the patio the view was still beautiful from inside All the food was excellent Chips were warm and were yummy My were the best of all If I something was very attentive and friendlyGreat view and the band was awesome Our waitress Jordan W was amazing She was so attentive and super nice Everything was great Would definitely go backWe are only visiting for a couple days and someone The Oasis I read the which about the view not the food We took a chance and were very happily Food was excellent were amazing were friendly and of course the view was spectacular Wish we lived closer so we could go moreShoddy tourist trap Garbage food on a grand view I say tear down this hole and put up a resort or a better restaurant First first speedy service for a large party insofar as getting us sat went Insofar as getting us went not so well I am finding that outside of fine dining or absolute chain garbage like s in this town are unwilling to suggest or advise you on anything To be fair I was full as so I t order The best thing was a bland with some overly sweet brisket sauce and melted cheese The for the chips tasted and to my corn chips like V sauce down The are scattered hither and yon clustered around the tables in a kind of awkwardly looming way I was wedged between the cinder block the umbrella shaft was set in and my to either side Vegetable like The broccoli was bright green without any delicate char and I don t usually think of broccoli when I think vegetable substitute for cuisine My basic Margarita was watery and unremarkable went unremarked and unfilled I think they re too busy with too limited a staff Should have some running around For this they the grat That s impressive Most new have done away with the grat because of the new rule on how to treat the grat at wage law I wonder if the management at The Oasis is aware of all that On my way out I was with these creepy bronze of in football gear staring cheerfully into a dark and grim future where they are battered for the profit of and the insatiable of theirBest view ever Food was actually pretty good despite the I read My husband and I went on a and it t as as I thought We sat at a table with a really nice view and had zero wait time Our server was very friendly and always made sure we had filled Can t wait to go backYou have to see the sunset they said You have to try the they said So we did We to make it out west on a night and to our surprise it was night The wait was about half an hour but we to snag a little patio set that had the perfect view and was conveniently next to a bar The staff still on us and even us get a table on the third floor in the room The place was How did I miss this memo Every with a live band There were lots of seated glad to see that this is an option for a fun group outing Be sure to try The Sipper s and grapefruit soda with a splash of elder flower liqueur You won t be disappointedGreat place to take fellow visiting from or just to lay back and have a nice cold This place is known for their pretty spectacular over Lake Travis just on the of From here you can catch of the outer hill country Dam a around this awesome lake Since it s start they had some pretty incredible expansion of the surrounding area with selling local as well as a local brewery just next door Highly recommend this place if in townAmazing view Great service is an amazing server By Far The Best Experience Me My Family Had My How Friendly She Was Definitely Coming Back AgainSuch a cool place We had dinner while the sun was setting and what an amazing view it was I will definitely be back to watch the sunset The service was also good considering our waiter had many tables to take care of The food was pretty good but really you re paying for the amazing view I would recommend this place to everyone It s huge and worth giving it a shotFlirty Check mango Check delicious Check plus the view Check star plus check heart check exclamation point this place is not the best in That does not mean it is not worthy of all the other compensating for it This place the view to die for The sunset is always perfect Go to the top floor where there s a live band on the while the sun goes down DO have that extra mango margarita don t get the You had better and your will too by the time the weekend s over I go to the oasis every time a friend comes to visit Not just because its a cool place for them to see but because it me warm fuzzy about I sit on that top deck with my fresh and watch the sun dip down below the horizonIt s amazing view with lighting fast food service I did the for two great value with food left over Considering it s a tourist destination the food is good It s a must try for both and alike EnjoyI really love this spot It s a special occasion place so I only go every so often The food is much better than people give it credit for and the are unreal Definitely worth a stop to anyone visitingLove the atmosphere of this place The view during sunset is It is also very busy during this time keep that in mind Awesome place and the food is decent tooThe steak and chicken were exceptional They made Me a Pina and strawberry also very yummy The waitress was very sweet and attentive I be backAmazing time every time I been here is not all about the food here but the food is very affordable if your not trying to spend of money on a meal because the view is worth it They have a little shop where they sell a lot of hand made I m the kind of person who different I lived in the area for in and I would totally recommend lunch out herewhat s up with all these crazy Of course the Oasis would be better if the food was better but I really don t think the food is as bad is everyone is The food I would give The rest I would give a trillion This is one of my all time favorite to take out of town and to come to with my I have never come here without thinking Wow is so beautiful Plus the I have come here for my first parent s weekend to celebrate passing my class ever my party dinner and even my own graduation dinner Please go here and judge for yourself if it s worth the driveWhat else can I say besides GREAT The atmosphere was great were great view was great was great waitress was great food was great This is a must come whenever you are in My and I will definitely be backGreat view Our waitress was super accommodating and the food was awesome Had a great time and next time we are in we will be backI m giving because of the view and ride there This place was absolutely gorgeous The scenery and whole experience out on the patio was unreal I ordered the steak which flavor and was extremely dry But I m from New and expect a lot of flavor in my food However I Highly recommend this place to everyone You won t be disappointed Also when you order You get to keep the glass Nice to have a collectible Make sure to by a lock on the way out and lock your love there Super cuteDespite the poor we gave this a shot and I m so glad because we had a great lunch It was of us and Mo took great care of us We all our food alcohol were perfectly reasonable and the view and atmosphere was perfect Especially the outdoor on our cloudy cool day The souvenir were fun tooAmazing view Great for taking out of to right before sunset I absolutely love the chicken wrap but unfortunately they only sell it during lunch and I try to indulge at Oasis when the sun is setting Their candied pecan grape strawberry salad is really great I had a bite of their and fried shrimp and I t too I definitely keep coming back as long as that salad is on the menu and the sun is still shiningcame here to see the sunset around so we in the sun for two and we felt so tired and almost but it s worth waiting I forgot about the food but it should be fine Sunset here is really beautifulI m giving because I only came for a drink and the view that s what you come here for The food t look amazing but the are doable and it s worth it all for the view are very attentive and sweetThe most amazing from a restaurant within a thousand get here before sunset more like an hour plus Before Sunset so you can get a table with a great View kick back and enjoy it the food I still haven t found out what s best on the menu the food itself is low and moderate the service notoriously bad comma many of the wait staff really really want to make a big difference but the way the whole thing comes together just never really And that sunset is amazingAfter all the review I read I was really when I saw this place I am trying to figure out why such bad review They had a ton of staff The food was very good and the service was great This is a must see The are amazing are breath takingThis is the place to go for a beautiful view while you are enjoying some good food I recommend coming in the evening and watching the sunset over lake Travis The dip was on point and the is a great healthy yet satisfying option I got one of the hurricane and they are strong so I see why there is a drink limit on those all I need is one This was my th time visiting and I can say each time been a memorable experienceThe chilled hatch green chili soup was excellent as were my fish My husband got the hamburger and he said it was very good flan very good our server was excellent as were all of her Of course the view is wonderful what a wonderful evening we had Oh yes the price we had aThis restaurant a lot of bad on Yelp because people t rating the whole experience We The Oasis while in at Resort And Spa The Oasis is a restaurant And no the food t amazing star stuff and that s the biggest complaint people have But when you compare one place to another place you have to compare to People are giving this place a bad review because they re rating only the food and it to other more upscale where you just go sit in a dining room But you don t go here simply for the food This restaurant t about just enjoying a meal It s about enjoying a meal while watching an amazing sunset over Lake Travis Practically the whole thing is chiseled out of the side of a cliff over high over the lake Watching the sun drop behind those at the other side of the lake from a table on the side of a cliff is why people line up and wait EVERY night of the week to eat here We were here on a night and the place was As far as the food goes honestly I d say the food was on par with maybe an El Phoenix or something similar It s not amazing but it s certainly not bad We what we had But again if you rate it only on the food you re simply missing the point of coming here Another big complaint I see in is the price Our bill for two was just under not counting we had while we Those ran another That our tab to a poverty Not what I d call terribly expensive for the whole experience For the food only Absolutely But let s be honest You re being naive if you expect this place not to charge a little more for the experience of dinner jutting out of the side of a cliff above Lake Travis while counting down the last of a beautiful sunset With and ringing and picture taking at that This place absolutely the setting of the sun every single day I really want everyone reading this to get that because I think this place t getting for what it is I don t think they let me post a link here but if you search for my name Cross along with the oasis lake travis you can probably pull up a video I shot while my wife and I were there You get it then Listen go somewhere else for mind blowing while you look at ugly on yellow and listen to really annoying music Come here to sit at a table on the side of a cliff Lake Travis with a bunch of other people watch an amazing sunset and cheer at the end and oh yeah have some food while you do it You do need to get there about an hour early though to get a good spot for the sunset because they don t take The exact time the sun will set is posted on their every dayThe view and atmosphere were amazing Our server was exceptional The food was good The were weak for the price All in all we will be backThe best place in Much better than those fake at the street and downtown The view is amazing Very cute building and decent and Highly it toI had nothing but good here This is one of my favorite to take out of The entrance is so impressive and a wonderful place to take Most recently I ordered one of the Oasis specialty I can t remember exactly what it was and it was delicious and strong I also ordered one of the daily It was a delightful tuna salad with They were also very generous with the tuna Everyone else to enjoy their as well I will continue to take my here to impress them with the and I hope I continue to have goodThis place the best view in The best time to to go is during sunset where you will see the best sunset This place is extremely crowded And the wait is pretty long there is in the area that you can go to while waiting Ice cream coffee clothes and souvenir as well I suggest not to get hung up on the food as the food is not great The are mediocre The best thing about this place is the view of lake Travis the sunset and great companyScenic await at The Oasis The beauty is similar to the in the coast of Which was where we went each summer when I lived in A must see when you next visitFor dancing on can t be beat are welcome the food is nothing to write home about but works in a pinch at least they have Live band that gotten better and better over the I rip them every weekThis review is for anyone looking for a venue to host a special event in one of the Oasis private We were wanting to host a th anniversary celebration When we read all of the mostly negative about the food and service we were somewhat concerned We were assured the banquet service had its own professional chef and Any on our end were quickly The staff was professional and very accommodating the room and were beautiful and the food was wonderful Our still tell us how wonderful everything was Would we plan another celebration at the Oasis again Absolutely YesThe Oasis is a place to sell people on during the spring and summer The view is and the scenery what a special city is It s also a place to party and let loose The are good And in of the food the menu sharply from previous That being said all of the negative are probably from who are not The Oasis audience period In short if you re need want proper wait service from the college or need to examine good food like you re an autopsy don t come You just ruin other people s good timeThe food is great but you come to the Oasis mostly for the BEAUTIFUL When I have people visiting from out of town I usually take them here because is beautiful and you can t really get a better view of the sunset and the lake anywhere in I recommend getting here around so there is not a long wait My favorite dish is the and the is also delicious Awesome restaurantThis truly is an Oasis the and is incredible Food and were reasonably priced for the location Food was fresh and delicious and were unique Absolutely a must see and visit Lake areBeautiful view Had and shrimp for my and spinach enchilada s for myself Food was amazing I wound up my with my son and tried one of his shrimp After dinner we sat in Starlight and to one of live that they had Overall a wonderful friendly evening I would The Oasis for food and viewI went there in my last trip to The view is incredible Food is good price is cheap I will give five Definitely unforgettable experienceBeautiful This is where the are We want on a day where there were wind so that was way too much fun The store told me this only once or twice a year so if you catch it definitely make a video The view along the lake will be your new profile pic so dress accordinglyCame here a few ago with my fiance and this was our second time to visit Honestly it was just as good as our first Hardly a wait because we beat the major dinner rush and the view we had was amazing The food was good and came out hot and fresh Service was good and we left very satisfied and happy It is a driver for us to go there but we will be going backStunning view and delicious Came here during weekend as a recommendation from a friend IT The food was superb and the view of the lake had me in awe the cute little gift shop inside along with the whole lock and key idea for to leave their mark on the restaurant It was fun getting to considering it s on a big hill I definitely start coming here every time I m in town forI have no idea why some of these are so low but I absolutely love this place We a company party in the Starlight room this week and had an amazing time The venue is incredible we all the and so we could enjoy the beautiful weather There was ample seating inside and outside to enjoy the beautiful sunset The staff was great never had to wait at the bar and the feast was delicious too We hired a band The and the venue was fully to help with their set up If you haven t been to the Oasis you are definitely missing out get yourself over there and you thank me for itThere are some that you the Traveler Visitor Explorer simply must visit as you wander the surface of the Planet The Oasis is one of those in I know I know you be Cool no Touristy stuff for you Me too but let s put that sentiment aside for a moment because in all actuality you be rubbing with more than The Oasis that I X s now been built upon the ashes of the previous iteration of the Oasis This one is bigger more complex and because it can accommodate more people it does or so I m told The level building this way and that way and atop a very high mountain with an unobstructed view of Lake Travis and the land surrounding it for as far as the eye can see Quite spectacular Evening is nice and are it s speciality While the food was not spectacular it was good and the service was very agreeable during the very busy and not so very busy times I So Do yourself and a friend or a favor and pay a visit to the Oasis Go prepared to immerse yourself in the surroundings the energy and the uniqueness of this destination It s a visit you not regretCame for and the view Left wanting to move here was pretty much the waitress ever Sold us on the We re pretty picky margarita but despite these being mixed they were actually pretty bomb Also had the chicken which to also be the best I ever had in my life I promise our are not low Go here and find out for yourselfAmazing food and delicious food and lots to do Live music on and when we were thereBest food we had in lake travis with the world class view Must go place while visiting travisI m giving the oasis five BASED on their food I m not sure why they have such low People a trained celebrity chef I thought the food was great I got the chicken They were fresh and light The sauce was amazing but not overwhelming the rice was delicious and the were good It was a different spin on an overdone dish was delicious My husband got the shrimp and he them as well and agreed with me on the and rice sides The and chips came for our appetizer and were great Thin and crispy not thick and filling like a lot of where you eat chips and it s a meal Our waiter was Will and we him My mango margarita was delicious We were there on a night around We were told it was a two hour wait but we only just over The only thing we were put off by was the We did read this from other There s probably of them at a time at the front We were up and they confirmed our party number Apparently a different random had and begun to walk away without SAYING A WORD or making any or eye contact towards us to indicate we were to follow her She came back and rather rudely said hey you are supposed to follow me Off There was another incident with a hostess as well that s not worth the but let s just say they make it obvious you re in their way and they re Will our server saved the attitude of the nightWe decided to see if the was worth the ride from and it was We sat out on one of the large balcony before it got too cold and we inside They were very accommodating even though the romantic sunset we were for never the overcast skies We had the shrimp chicken and beef which were great But it was the Chicken appetizer that stole the show There were so many of the little bacon wrapped chicken oh my God We could have eaten that as the meal It alone made the experience wonderfully unique The adult were perfect too Definitely recommend if you re in the areaWhat can you possibly say negative about The Oasis It s just too beautiful there to be by minor like maybe the food p I went to see a band there last weekend and it was absolutely AWESOME Venue AND bandWe brought our to The Oasis It is as beautiful as it is fun It is as fun as it is yummyFantastic spot for brunch Five for the view alone for sure I thought the food and were pretty darn good too I had the a la pina and it was yummy We also got the double dip and the was amazing The was good but I have definitely had better also The view the view oh my lord that view I could sit there all day and drink and enjoyAwesome view of Lake Travis Three of entertainment food and Great date night restaurant and wonderful made hereGreat food and great band tonight and dancing Had a great time

good we had to get the were amazing We got and shrimp I both very much We were at all the negative feed back we received about the food Maybe we got lucky and just ordered the right off the menu or maybe we were just very hungry Either way we were very happy about coming hereDon t let the bad stop you from giving this place a chance honestly it like people just want to complain I came to the Oasis for lunch and overall it was an amazing experience The view is completely stunning and I m not sure if it s recent development but my water cup was never empty and my was really good I also tried the Tropical depression drink and it was absolutely delicious Not too much alcohol and not too little either All in all it was a really good experience and I be when I am back inI absolutely love this place What a beautiful restaurant and nice small around We had a wonderful dinner Food was hot and t take long to get at all Our wait for a table was only we just before sunset were amazing as well Will come back many more timesA bit more expensive than I thought it would be but worth every penny We had maybe a hour wait for our table which like nothing because we went upstairs had which were so good and chips and while watching the sunset and listening to music By the time we sat at our dinner table we were already saying that we be back once a month Food was good service was even better this place is definitely for the and thoWe came to eat here for our anniversary was our waitress and was very attentive More than one person came by our table to see if we if any kind Is the menu expensive Maybe a little but the experience was incredible and the view of the lake while eating t hurt either It s a great place to go to splurge on yourselfYou have to visit this wonderful restaurant you will not be disappointed by the and shopping The pork was great and full of pork and the was good as wellWe this place We read the and we re skeptical to go here We had personal so we went for it and man are we glad we did The food was delicious The service was a tad slow but it was very busy The food was hot well flavored and we were definitely full when leaving We had the the Steak and our weird friend ordered a The view and atmosphere was spectacular Go at head straight to the floor for first come first serve seating No waiting and half for a tableSo my sister in law took us out to the Oasis for lunch Upon it like something I would see in World with the colorful and design When you enter the the place but the real attraction is the view What an amazing view this If you decide to eat outdoors know that they have LOTS of I had the shrimp with the rice and and I was stuffed The added icing on the cake was the Oasis Cooler drink and that was really good I do recommend the Tropical Depression as it is fruity and delicious Everyone else had the and that was equally good too If ever in I would recommend trying this place The is a bit above average but well worth it the servicefirst off i would like to thank for us to hold a special celebration for my sweet the service we received from the entire staff was outstanding the food was good the view was amazing thank you very muchThe service is amazing great atmosphere and wonderful view coming here I recommend everyone especially if you are craving foodI m so glad we came The view as so many have said was spectacular our server was great The food was good and the company made it extra special Try the flan it s really good Love all the around the grounds Definitely something to see and do inI love The Oasis I be honest that the food t the best food that you ever eat in your life but that s not why people come from all over to visit The food is still good in my opinion but the view is spectacular You have to eat dinner here at sunset It s amazing The Oasis is my favorite restaurant simply for the atmosphere We had dinner here right before my fiancee and we our rehearsal dinner here The staff was great and accommodating Everything ran perfectly and our out of town it We always come hereGreat Lake Lunch here was great Service excellent Had chicken sandwich and beef both were very good But the view though second to noneI to write a review so people t be turned away from this place because of the current low This place was an absolutely wonderful experience I went with my family for an early lunch at am on a Service was quick and courteous The waiter was well informed about any dietary that we had We ordered not realizing they have free and as an appetizer but that s which was decent tuna salad a salmon dish and shrimp all of which were extremely delicious I had no about the food Food came quickly and the waiter took our away right as we finished Everyone already that the view is spectacular so I don t need to go into that We did come right at opening so I m sure the whole experience was better because of the lower volume of at that time I know most people like to come at night but if you want a smooth experience come right at opening if you canAfter reading the I was super hesitant about my family here But I d figure that this is one of the best Let me just say that I am so happy I came because it was an amazing experience You should already know that if you re going to come on a weekend you re going to have to wait to get seated That s just a no brainer I came on a and we were seated within We got to sit outside with the amazing view Service was not bad at all could it have been better maybe but given that our waitress had two big she still came to check up on us Now here s the thing with many their main t all that great coming from someone who grew up eating food and still goes to a lot of So a piece of advice order the basic that you know they can t really mess up on We got the mix for two And it did not disappoint the were so juicy and flavorful the were so warm and the sides t bad either The food came out right on time and at the same time All of us our and were pretty satisfied I m definitely coming backThe view at this spot is probably the best in all of The food was a great end to a great day on the lake The are fruity and strong The mango are wonderfulJust back to after being away for and decided to have our year anniversary dinner at the Oasis last Contrary to many of the we had a great time Quick service in the bar while we for a table close to sunset so very busy Table was ready when they said min and we got to see a great sunset Our server was attentive even though he was very busy He did a great job of taking care of us The food was good platter and mixed chicken beef We both and the were large we took home Lots of fun great and good foodThe chicken appetizer was one of the best I ever had Who t like chicken wrapped in bacon and with barbecue sauce The margarita was really good and a great way to enjoy the sunset The view was amazing It made you feel like you were in a more exotic location We had the chicken for two and they gave us plenty of chicken enough for three or four people Our service was excellent maybe due to the fact that we were near the main entryway Overall I think it s worth

service Despite all the COVID they still to provide a great environment and everyone was social I do miss the rest of the menu but completely understand the Thank you Oasis for still open at less capacityThis was a feature event for my wife on her birthday unfortunately I made a boneheaded decision to depart to the location later than I should have because I her to enjoy the view off the seating area of the restaurant that Lake Travis and a romantic sunset The food and customer service was first class and we will return during the spring summertime I can tell you we initially were told to expect a to wait but only had to wait a of about it we will returnThe view is what this place dine outdoors if you can The top shelf were amazing so are the chips and they serve to start off and I ordered the which was pretty good My also the All I had was the shrimp cocktail after that the sauce was good I t say that what I ordered was anything out of this world but the service was great the are amazing I d say it s a great place to be in with a group of family and maybe have a fewOrdered the They came very fast all sizzling and hot with some burned up A stellar dish in my opinionReading the perplexed me and frankly t have me excited to go My wife and I due to the Don t listen to them Yes yes the and sunset is amazing but we found the food good I think the problem is the presentation Even my t have the visual appeal that I but they were outstandingly flavorful chicken and shrimp You pay a good premium but the real estate is worth it The brewery upstairs is a great place to out while you wait for your table Give it a tryDinner at sunset is a MUST The were great and so filling Awesome chips and took great care of usOne of my favorite for dinner Nice atmosphere good food and a beautiful viewMy cousin and I were in town for one day and I had seen lots of from other from The Oasis We to go somewhere different for lunch so despite the poor on Yelp we headed that way I told her that we were going for the atmosphere and not to expect much from the restaurant We were seated in a very reasonable amount of time In fact by the time we went to the porch and took a look at the view and a margarita from the bar our table was ready Our waiter was so attentive He was constantly moving the because it was a hot summer day and he was really working to keep everyone in the shade The service was great the food was great we got some and and the view is just amazing I m not sure why the were so low but we clearly went on a good day and really our visit I d definitely go back to The OasisThis place is awesome The are really cool I just here from so it was the first place I was told to go but I the food was Totally wrong the food is great The Crawfish are

Personality and made our visit extra special We a Shrimp Cocktail which had huge shrimp and was the perfect share item Although the gentleman who our cocktail a Shrimp cocktail with one shrimp laying on the tray We him about the extra shrimp and he told us it was from another order That odd We and she right away went to the kitchen to confirm and the cook said No the Cocktail come with She quickly brought us another Shrimp which was delicious and well worth the even the gentleman sitting behind us said he the conversation and thought the guy should have up to his error Our Chicken Lettuce were also excellent with two tasty All around a great experience Thank you for your super serviceBeautiful place to watch sunset Not the best food because i m spoiled by sI don t understand all the bad about this place my friend and I went on a night and of course the restaurant was busy but their staff were very quick to put our name on the waiting list in the of our waiting we the venue and took amazing and ordered patron on the top bar and we were about to finish our when our table was ready As soon as we checked in with the hostess they us our table the waiter was very friendly and quick to bring our food We ordered beef for two and it was delicious tender meat great seasoning the were on point I recommend to use valet instead of self parking their service is really good it took less then min to bring our car This place was an amazing experience definitely would like to go back again soonI have read the good and bad about the oasis and would like to add my own perspective as a former restaurant operator We went for lunch last at around We had been before the fire operation and always were satisfied with our experience When we the front door a young staffer was cleaning the glass and the door to let us enter We were immediately and brought to a table outside at the edge of the deck with an unobstructed view of the lake The tables were shaded with and our hostess the to provide complete coverage for all Other the as without being We ordered and promptly and we a few about the menu which our server completely Our were from the Northeast and not completely familiar with cuisine The food we was properly and attractively I had the shrimp and they were very fresh and excellent The shrimp crisp and tender inside their light batter coating All were fresh and unblemished We were by a very competent floor manager who was for customer satisfaction Our server also frequently checked on us and the for our comfort The day was sunny and hot but the constant breeze and the kept us comfortable The were higher than we would pay for the same in The food was as good or better than we have had at some The service was and the setting was spectacular People who complain about the are not considering that this is a unique place to dine and there is a price for that Our could not stop exclaiming about the whole experience When we were leaving the door was being again They care While we were in the lobby and leaving a group of about thirty and came in without a reservation and were taken care of immediately without any appearance of discomfort on the part of the staffThere is nothing quite like sitting on the veranda enjoying the most scenic and beautiful view over Lake Travis The atmosphere here is superb The conversation is a little better The food is a little better The air up here is a little better I could not visit the area and not come have dinner at The Oasis The view is beautifulThe oasis great of lake Travis That being said we ahead to see if they service dogs being our year old we were assured by the manager it was fine We come to find the host was extremely rude when we the host stand before even greeting us rolled her and stated they don t allow dogs without even why the dog was with us we even had the note Incase they We put our name on the list and had a drink at the bar but decided to leave and go somewhere else being it upset my year old mother The only reason I am giving them is the manager who was very professional and understanding We are defiantly come back to give it a second try without Ma thanks to the manager and his professionalism Thank you for being so understanding when dealing with such as oursCame here for our first anniversary and was not disappointed The view was amazing We got and to stand out and watch the sunset Once we were seated for dinner our waitress was excellent and extremely friendly Food was very good and the were better Definitely a place to see if you re visiting or looking for a good date nightThis is MUST SEE when you come to You have to come here and have at Sunset BE U TI is square At sunset they take all down for the perfect photo Go to the gift shop and buy your heart lock They have sharpie so you can write on it Lock your heart on the gate Throw the key in the lake for good luck GreatSo full disclosure I live on this property literally of a mile away I love the staff the view is amazing and it like you re in a different world on a nice sunny day The big news is that the are back It was pretty odd that a restaurant did not have but you have to remember the Oasis is one of a kind It is in fact the restaurant in the United not attached to a hotel The multiple and made it very to bring out consistently hot Another problem which I did not understand until they is that it is not legal for a restaurant to microwave your food So basically if they get the food to you cold because of the long distance the move and then you it to be they actually have to remake it Then you end up eating later than anyone else you re sitting with and it for a tough dining experience In any event they re trying again and we were there opening night They were hot and great and hopefully when the come they be able to handle it To be totally honest the Oasis is the place you go to to drink and sit back and enjoy the view If you understand that and especially if you for a shot of Grand in your margarita I promise you have a great experience P Full disclosure I live at this property Literally There is a subdivision that its entrance between the parking lots I come here year round and I am here in mornings walking dogs before it I am good with the owner but I pay for my I do not wait in line much though The restaurant grounds are magnificent Beau is a decorator and the of very famous people Take some time and look at the grounds the and the He great pride in the appearance and it You can spend the day looking for The are phenomenal The staff I know them personally are very nice young and some older people who really try hard Beau tried hard over the to get the best team and I think he is there now Beau is also very generous and personally donated a lot of to a charity that to undeveloped to surgically repair congenital facial He donated money and personally gone as a volunteer to these He also countless young as they had at this iconic restaurant The food is better now with an menu This restaurant is the in the US not attached to a hotel It food on the level of a cruise ship on holiday The menu is now designed to help this challenge The best part is the and the I would strongly suggest visiting this restaurant Take time to absorb the grounds and the Tell them you want the perfect Melt down with extra grand Mariner the and Sherry Enjoy the view ask for and Sherry sAmazing place really really amazing food unbelievable sunset I think everyone should go see a sunset The Oasis on Lake Travis Beef were amazingThis was on my list of to do while in Since my friend in it was a quick little jaunt over to The Oasis The place is quirky and fun definitely that touristy but I like that We went on a weekday mid day and the only complaint I had is that a lot of the little were closed which was a shame because both of us saw stuff we may have gotten had they been open We stopped at the restaurant for a quick snack and to take in the view The service was great We got the with I thought they were good I d go back and try something else The view is mainly what you come here for anyways and it t disappointAmazing a must if u ever visit Beer are amazing food is mediocre Service is pretty good I would highly recommend coming for a sunsetBeef and the view are AMAZING I recommend went with a couple and truly a fabulous timeGreat place to have dinner with a great view Food was decent were a little high for it being food But I that knowing how nice it and how busy it was I would go again You can t beat that view try and go during sunset We went at and it was very very hot on the balconyHad no with service or food View is excellent There was plenty of staff to handle the people here It was busy but not overly crowded They also will pick you up I parking lot and give a ride to restaurant entrance Walk is not far at all Not sure about parking garage Food was good and came out in a timely manner Would recommend this restaurant Also had some small to look inScrew all the negative This place is phenomenal in every way Service was fast and friendly the manager on staff was great food was good as well Lastly the view was worth every second This place truly is specialAs a resident of the hill country I felt the need to give The Oasis a positive review for more than their spectacular We ate there a week ago and we were absolutely delighted with the much quality of their food After of settling for just I must give the kitchen a way to go on serving a delicious beef and chicken It s about time but we look forward to trying more tasty while enjoying the viewA friend of mine brought me as a treat I read the before going and they are accurate as far as the food is concerned so I t have any high I was with how much food came for the price The chips were out of this world and the white made the dish exceptional The chicken was dry but the tasted perfect You definitely won t go home hungry The view of the sunset was spectacular I also like the rolling and a view of the lake water skier and I like the lock everywhere and it for a romantic meal You will find more than happy to take your photo in front of it I would recommend what time sunset is and get there at least an hour before We had a great seat along the fence on the patio The are constantly on the and making sure that you have enough water to drink Come to find out it s the restaurant in the nation and it s quite a sight to see There s a gift store and at least another restaurant there as well It beautiful a spaceship and other infrastructure and You basically go for the nostalgia and what you could make of it I would definitely go again particularly because I did not get a chance to see everything God willing that I have another chance to go I would do one thing differently and that would be to try one of the by the Enjoy the viewMy all time favorite restaurant in Best view and experience I only recommend one item the beefWhat a fun place to visit The sunset was amazing We went on a night to watch the sunset and get a drink that ended up being everyone s idea The place was busy with several big of family and The area Oasis is at is very fun and several other Great place to visitThe oasis is an amazing venue to take a gas and out of town or s to and we even go as in the food can be hit or miss however they generally do a good job Stick to the you be fine the are great it s a huge restaurant so Service can be slow sometimes plan ahead before sunset get there early and then or before sunset go ahead and order an extra drink for yourself you love itGreat steak and with a terrific view of Lake Travis The steak was so tender and seasoned well The t as strong as I d have but it s a great family environmentGreat Tuna Salad Beautiful view of lake Travis Very good service Can not come wait to come back for another taste of their foodI went here and the view was amazing The food was over priced but really good if you want a snack I recommend the but dont get the lemonade from the bar in my opinion it was disgusting sour and bitter You also have a lot of to take really cool Over all I it here and highly recommend itThis place was awesome The food was great and the view was amazing We came right before the sunset and got some great They also have a place where people put a lock on the railing and you can write a message on the lock and if you go back your lock will still be there My daughter really thatBest scenery in Few for We have to stop by every time we visit Worth your timeIf you are the area you MUST check this place out The are amazing the staff is exceptionally beautiful and did I mention THE Can t make it to well this is the next best thing I can t wait to go back to enjoy this piece of hidden heavenI love this place The first time I went here was for a wedding in the s and then I recently re twice and it was BETTER I realize a lot of people have become jaded but there is no reason to rate lower than a I have been to several in and the wait poor attitude and that you find at smaller are completely over rated The wait staff bartender and were more than helpful

order chips and and Especially it you are like me and live on a tight budget Even if you dont have a bunch to spend tho you can make it work and still have a great timeHey this place was great The view is just incredible and the food was pretty good too my alcohol lemonade drink and it was nice outside Very happy with my lunch and can t wait to come backWe visit The Oasis every trip we can and it is always amazing Today we made a detour on our way home to celebrate my birthday and was not disappointed Even though they were about wearing the mask to and from the table had the tables spread out for social it was still an incredible atmosphere and awesome food Can t wait to visit againI am a BIG fan of The Oasis you can t find a more amazing beautiful place to eat than this place the the size of the Oasis is overwhelming it s a great stop or out of towner touring stop point the place is full of cool and art work and the view it s just breathe taking The parking can be a bit tricky on the especially on you have to park on pebble rocky road sometimes b c it s so full but they do offer shuttle golf drive you back and forth and valet service The price is maybe a bit high but it is a tourist attraction so it is the food portion was huge but the quality I d say maybe equal or a tiny bit better than Chili s free dessert is a nice touch speed on could use some improvement over all a great brunch lunch sunset dinner experience here I d love to go again one day soon when it upGo for the cold and Great time with Be sure to sit on the terrace otherwise why goThis is my second time being here took my sister for the first time and she it Great atmosphere amazing and are absolutely delicious We were given the option of inside or outside seating which you have to come here for the view If you re visiting it s a mustAfter reading many of the not so good I was a little concerned that we chose a bad place for our night out of town cousin s dinner I don t typically write but after last night s experience I have to write one I am happy to type that we did not experience one single thing that many about Not one single thing From the hostess to the bartender to the food runner to the bus person every staff member I saw had a smile on their face All of those had hustle That alone was awesome to witness Our server was over the top on top of There was never an empty water glass margarita bottle of beer or coffee cup Our food hot and the portion sizes were more than fair for the price The menu something for everybody My group s order was all over the place and everybody was very happy with their selection Bottom line anybody can find something to complain about if they choose to look hard enough I gave this because I went in knowing the bad and left with great service great food and a gorgeous sunset Don t let the bad keep you awayGreat location Beautiful Food a little but overall good service was nice and fast All staff was very friendly There is also nice around the if you find yourself waitingAmazing service and amazing hospitality Thank you for being patient and as awesome as the sunset Definitely will come back thank you for the great experience OasisWOW The hubby and I decided to visit and were told to go visit the Oasis As we drove towards Lake Travis I immediately and enjoying the surroundings Surrounded by greenery and some beautiful the Oasis is a fun destination and totally a must for those who visit Whereas downtown up to it s Dirty reputation of being somewhat grimy and overcrowded Lake Travis and the Oasis was beautiful The staff was super friendly and helpful and were fast with food and There s a huge selection of craft beer and of good eats we for corn beer and the mixed which were absolutely delicious The Oasis is a series of and we went to the brewery around and a lot of are closed and vacant so don t set super high The reason I m giving this place a is because of the fun time you can have on the patio If the weather is nice outside you HAVE to sit on the patio It s the view that s totally worth it My husband and I had so much fun hanging out enjoying the fresh air and a few in the sun I can not wait to come backDelicious place great food great service and wonderful atmosphere with stunning of Lake Travis This place better than what it for sureMy absolute favorite place to take and family when they come to visit The stunning of Lake Travis are beautiful Recently I had a worker come into town and where we should eat He said take me somewhere that best so to The Oasis we went Covid times have making a little shorter most of the time Service is a little too but still friendly Food is good but honestly it s the view you re here for There is a brewery on the top level which I most often visit and the beer is good are limited so look before you go to avoid disappointment Overall the whole area and atmosphere are amazing and I highly recommend itWonderful place Awesome view Good food and great beer Best sunset view I have ever seenMe and my family really ourselves The view the food the and great were AMAZING We absolutely it HIGHLY We can t wait to go back again We did while there If you want to see the beautiful view please feel free to check out our videoWe love the Very great but very place but the food was very good The were amazing though of lake Traviswas our sever and he was such an energetic and efficient guy Definitely knew what he was doing and how to manage such a busy establishment while health Thanks for such a great time We had the bottomless Chips and which were phenomenal to start to other I been to We also split a chicken pecan salad and it quickly as it was quite refreshingFood t all that but just decent however the place is worth a try Beautiful facility and great view Service is also excellent They need to give out a sauce for They had no choice on at all Left my glasses on the table and were decent enough to turn it it That is alwaysA nice escape into the hill country beautifully set over Lake Travis Nice lively gift shop boardwalk and beautifulI knew the view would be amazing and we were not disappointed When it came to the food I was a little unsure what to expect since I read a few of the bad before dining We ordered bottomless chips and All of the food was great at least what we ate Wait time was about which was to be Took about to get our food once we ordered Overall great experience I Would definitely come back againUpon approaching the restaurant it is very imposing with a parking garage and sprawling lot Please take in the glass overlook with the best and picture opportunity The entire place is of beautiful stone with ever elevation Plenty of to browse while you wait for a table We quick seating right on the balcony with great Food was excellent we had shrimp and chicken were very good expensive but very large so fair priced A rain storm came in abruptly and the staff got us quickly and painlessly We were very It is an impressive place with its beautiful and sprawling In my limited experience I can t see where you could go wrong here'}"
